The eight black stainless steel units, uniquely integrated within the station environment to create a narrative associated with everyday life in the neighborhood--a life, for most, that revolves around the subway station. The focal points of connections are linked between the home and the heart, both literally and metaphorically. Each silhouetted representation is displayed in different positions: skateboarding, selling books, walking on the street and taking pathways to the station. Man-made fragments of the 20th and 21st century of Bronx history are shown, such as the subway line, networks, electricity cables, telephone poles and other elements. The sculptures are imbued with visible presence not only for those who built them, but for those here today, tomorrow and beyond.",

Butterflies similarly are used to signify the life cycle, from gestation to birth to the change into adulthood.  The importance of music and rhythm are shown through African drums, a saxophone, and trumpets, all rendered in vivid tones of red, gold and purple contrasted to receding shades of green, blue and turquoise.  \u00d2The Franklin Avenue-Fulton Street area\u00d5s rich African-American heritage is being reborn,\u00d3 says Pryor.  Change and opportunity are arriving and the shuttle both encourages and reflects the community\u00d5s new optimism.

The Ailanthus tree is ubiquitous to Brooklyn and found in unlikely and inhospitable places. It\u00d5s beautiful lance shaped leaves pop up in cracks in the sidewalk and concrete walls and is a metaphor for the courage and determination of the people of Brooklyn. Chandelier references the idea of \u00d2lighting the way\u00d3 and is a reminder of the feeling when the lights of the train appear down the tracks, signaling the journey home. Hummingbirds are elegant and high energy and represent the vibe of Brooklyn. In creating the artwork, Baker recalled her childhood car journeys with her parents and the feeling of spotting an iconic colorful building. Baker seeks to capture the same elated, moment of wonder and believes public art can be transformative and speak to everyone.",

        "art_description": "Artist James Garvey hand forged functional bronze sculptures and designed them to literally integrate into the station\u00d5s architecture. The nine sculptural Lariat Tapers wrap around the Tuscan columns at the historic Wall Street station. Since the station is located in the financial district, Garvey crafted these functional seats to convey the location of the wind-swept \u00d2corridors of finance\u00d3. The tapers swirl in a clockwise direction around the columns to depict the motion of trains swooping into the station. Comparing the Lariat Tapers to Garvey\u00d5s precedent artwork Lariat Seat Loops sited at the 33rd Street Station (6), the Lariat Tapers are realized as a more sensuous form, a deliberate attempt to interact with and catch the attention of commuters who work in the financial district. At the 33rd Street Station, the dynamic between the Seat Loop and the historic I-beam column imparts a uniquely fresh impression, while Garvey\u00d5s design for the Wall Street Station acknowledges, respects, and highlights the station\u00d5s history and architecture.",

These trees provide a canopy of shade on the walk to and from the subway, shelter during an unexpected rain shower, and soften the urban geometry. Similarly, the subway and sidewalks provide the public with a path to jobs, adventures, and visits with friends. The artist chose branching trees that are found on the sidewalks and yards of the neighborhoods surrounding the Avenue P station including beech, dogwood, and maple trees. \n\nBattenfield\u00d5s paintings of twisting boughs, and flowering and leafing trees, are set against a pristine white sky to explore the dynamic between abstraction and figuration. Her selection of color is intentionally atypical of nature, providing a wide palette of pigments. Fabricated in laminated glass by Depp Glass and placed above the platform stairs, the bright and welcoming tree canopies unfold as subway riders enter and exit the station. The colorful trees animate the station\u00d5s environment like the liveliness of nature itself.",

        "art_date": "2001",
        "art_material": "Glass Mosaic",
        "art_description": "In these dramatic murals the artist, Jack Beal, cleverly likens the subway to classical myths that deal with the relationship between goings-on on aboveground and below ground. \n\nTrained in art school as an abstract expressionist, Jack Beal soon turned toward figuration in his works, eventually achieving great success and becoming a leading realist.  He often stated, \u00d2I will never be satisfied until I obtain the believability of the seventeenth century Dutch painters.\u00d3    Ironically, now his interest has turned back to abstraction, he says.\n\nThe artist explains that he based this work on the Greek myth of Persephone.  In The Return of Spring mythological figure Persephone is shown running to her mother, Demeter, according to the terms of a pact Demeter had made with Hades, Persephone\u00d5s husband: Persephone would be allowed to return to earth and her mother for the rest of eternity \u00d0 provided that she ate nothing before leaving the Underworld.  But \u00d0 shades of Eve in Eden \u00d0 Persephone spied a pomegranate on the way out and could not resist taking a bite . . . \n\nThe Onset of Winter completes Beal\u00d5s story.  Persephone, having eaten the pomegranate, now is forced to renegotiate the contract.  From now on, she is allowed to spend six months on earth, but must spend the other six down below, autumn and winter in the Underworld with her husband and spring and summer aboveground with her mother \u00d0 thus the origin of the seasons.  A rueful Persephone is shown at the top of the stairs, knowing she must descend but not wanting to go. \n\nAs with Lichtenstein and Lawrence, place and time \u00d0 a particular place and a particular time, but with an implied universality \u00d0 are the theme.  Time passes, people and things come and go, but there is always a d\u017dj\u02c6 vu quality lurking just beneath the surface.",

        "art_description": "For the Astoria-Ditmars Blvd station, painter Elisabeth Condon created Urban Idyll, a series of thirty-six laminated glass panels located throughout the station\u00d5s mezzanine. Condon worked with glass fabricator Tom Patti Design to translate her large-scale paintings into permanent laminated glass artwork. Each image and gesture is initially hand painted. They carry multiple interpretations that shift and unfold as travelers pass by from street to subway and back again, embodying a textile \u00d2tree of life\u00d3 pattern familiar to many cultures. \n\nTo create her glass artwork, Condon recombined sections from a variety of her paintings into new configurations and compositions. In Urban Idyll, time unfolds in liquid pours of color, undulating gestures, and birds, trees and flowers at various stages of flight, perch and bloom. These elements turn and flow rhythmically across the sequences of the glass artwork, evoking the transitions of travel. The linear, elongated compositions echo musical notations and film frames, dear to Astoria\u00d5s cinematic history. Placed in East, West, North and South locations in the station\u00d5s mezzanine, Urban Idyll is designed to be read from right to left, like a scroll, recording the passage of time through vivid color. On the East passageway, the artwork welcomes and references sunrise, as bursts of yellow transition to orange and reds as the day moves on. The South-facing artwork offers respite at high noon when the sun is high and bright, and a flying bird in the West passageway escorts us through a saturated sunset toward evening, and home. Diverse paint applications reveal numerous approaches and viewpoints, echoing in visual form the experience of successive generations of immigrants from around the world who flourish in a culture they co-create, much like that of Astoria, Queens.",

Once, she even created a shrine titled Blessing of the Light Before Entering the Subway.  She became especially well acquainted with the \u00d2El\u00d3 in the Bronx while riding it daily for many years.  From this vantage point she witnessed extraordinary, even \u00d2magical,\u00d3 things, she says.   Explaining the source of her inspiration for the work, Bursztyn says that the birds and trees told her stories.  She viewed tiny gardens of lushness and dreamed of the exotic animals living in the zoo nearby.  In the evening, sunsets filled the sky with a kaleidoscope of color.  The train rides almost felt like riding through the clouds.  Then the artist strove to bring new meaning to familiar locations by sharing her visions with subway riders.  Dina Bursztyn has been creating public art for more than 20 years and through it, she says, she seeks to create contemporary mythology and present fresh possibilities, both literally and metaphorically.",

        "art_description": "All of us find ourselves from time to time musing on our surroundings and the people in them, how they have both individual and universal qualities.  Ralph Fasanella chose the subway as the place for his reverie; the artist was infatuated with the city\u00d5s transportation lifeline, the diversity of the New Yorkers who use it, and the accomplishments of the workers who keep it running.  \n\nTalking about Subway Riders 45 years after he completed it, the artist reflected:\n\nI\u00d5d ride the subway every day, back and forth to my machine shop job. I\u00d5d ride and ride and sketch and sketch.  I love the subway.  It pulls the city together, pulls people together in a magic way.  Here I show the subway riders at night after a hard day\u00d5s work.  Everyone is separate, alone, but very much together.  It\u00d5s noisy with the creaks and squeals, but peaceful too, because we move to a rhythm and cadence that gets inside us; that\u00d5s comforting, like the noise of the city itself.  The subway makes the city work, makes the city great.  And behind the scenes \u00d0 unseen and unheard \u00d0 the transit workers drive the trains, grease the wheels, and keep the engines running.  They perform miracles.  They get us through another day.\n\nA lifelong New Yorker, Ralph Fasanella was born in the Bronx and grew up in Greenwich Village, which at that time had a large Italian-American population but whose already sizable community of artists and writers was continuing to grow.  He worked as an iceman and then as a union organizer, while on the side produced a number of paintings in what would become known as urban folk style.\n\nAlthough his first exhibition was in the 1940s, Ralph Fasanella was essentially unknown to the larger public until the 1970s, when folk art collectors avidly began to vie for his works.  Many of his paintings have somber overtones, focusing on political and labor struggles.  Others have happier subjects, including sports, the city\u00d5s dynamic street life \u00d0 and of course subway rides.",

Imagery in the artwork includes houses atop stilts and wheels, ladders, the North Star, footprints, recurring circular patterns (both complete and incomplete), and African symbols of spiritual centering.

Hellion Equilibrium provides an evolving spectrum of color and sharp-edged shapes that invites the viewer to reflect upon the concepts of motion, scale, light, mapping, and social space through the use of organically evolving forms.\n\nMorris, throughout her career, has been fascinated by a wide range of visual references, including GPS technologies, topological mapping, and industrial graphics. Her practice has always been interested in patterns of movement within the city, whether it be production, commuters, pedestrians, vehicles or currency. Most recently, she has incorporated QR codes referencing specific locations into her paintings, visualizing movement and how it is thought to effect human behavior and perception.\n\nHellion Equilibrium, fabricated by Glassworks, references an abstracted rendering of the 39 Av-Dutch Kills station\u00d5s GPS location, and features a spectrum of color and shapes that invite commuters to reflect upon various concepts, and most of all, the ideas of motion and municipal movement and travel.",

Inspired by the buildings and homes of the Ozone Park/South Richmond Hill neighborhoods, Linda Ganjian created the detailed designs of Home Sweet Home, taking the visual vocabulary of lace and applying it to the architecture found in the area. From the rows of identical-seeming houses, the artist studied the forms, patterns, and textures that make each house unique. She captures with embroidery-like precision the diagonally-oriented aluminum siding, baroque ironwork on fences, zig-zag tiles, elephant garden statues and more. These often-seen, but overlooked decorative details are not entirely unique to this neighborhood but form the notion of home in our subconscious, defining the way we experience the city and place. Home Sweet Home honors the builders and craftsmen behind the urban architecture as much as the residents who enliven and take pride in it.",

        "art_description": "Eamon Ore-Giron worked with fabricator Mosaicos Venezianos de M\u017dxico to translate six original oil paintings into 24 glass mosaic panels that adorn the northbound and southbound platforms at the Bay Pkwy station in Brooklyn. Ore-Giron visualizes the world as abstract forms and shapes, and envisions the interaction and interplay of these shapes as a reflection of societal dynamics. This exchange between forms and his use of geometries symbolizes the ways in which people of different communities \u00d1 such as those surrounding the Bay Pkwy station \u00d1 negotiate their relationships with each other and new places, a process of reinvention and creation.  \n\nThe 12 mosaic panels on each platform reference the corresponding journey. As commuters travel southbound towards Coney Island, Ore-Giron\u00d5s designs reference the natural world, with fluid arcs and warm colors evoking the feelings one might have when going to the beach. The northbound platform mosaics mimic the movement of gears and the mechanics of the human-made world, conjuring feelings of New York\u00d5s ecstatic urban environment.  \n\n\"People\u00d5s Instinctive Travels: Homage to the Tribe\" originates from Ore-Giron\u00d5s \"certain nostalgia for global modernism,\" wherein \"public works meant to create a kind of civic mindedness and unity.\" His dynamic visual language references this unity, combined with the timelessness of indigenous and craft traditions. It is Ore-Giron\u00d5s hope that these mosaics will offer subway riders a space to see the world anew through the shapes, forms, colors, and movements of these artworks.",

        "art_description": "Robert Blackburn\u00d5s creation at 116th Street and Lexington Avenue evokes the local surroundings through dynamic abstract patterns that suggests the color and movement of the streets above rather than depicting the built environment.  They bring a timeless beauty into the transit environment. \n\nOf Jamaican ancestry, Blackburn was born in Summit, New Jersey, and spent his formative years in Harlem, where he worked with renowned African American artists Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence.  A master printmaker, Blackburn was known nationally for having profoundly affected American art by refocusing attention on printmaking, in particular through his Printmaking Workshop in Harlem, which he founded in 1948.  This was particularly so in the case of abstract color lithography.  Many students fondly remember him for his influence on them as teacher and mentor.  Romare Bearden spoke for a whole generation when, in A Tribute to Robert Blackburn, he said, \u00d2One of the most outstanding facets of Robert Blackburn\u00d5s character is his desire and willingness to help the people who are working with him.\u00d3  Blackburn died in April 2003, at age eighty-two.  \n\nIn 2001, MTA Arts for Transit commissioned Blackburn to create a work for the 116th Street and Lexington Avenue subway station in Harlem.  In failing health, he chose artist Mei-Tei-Sing Smith, a Bearden Fellow at the Printmaking Workshop, to assist him on what would prove to be his last major project.  Once completed, 30-by-40-inch maquettes were sent to Germany, where they were enlarged and manufactured into large ceramic and glass mosaics that today serve as a monument to Blackburn\u00d5s bold use of color and masterful abstractions.",

She worked with fabricator Erksin Mitchell, who interpreted her artwork into three groupings of faceted glass panels. Each is a striking portrayal of organic ocean forms made radiant by the strong light that reflects off the nearby ocean.\n\nHirsch, inspired by childhood experiences, explores the universe beneath the seas through her artwork. As a child, she was fascinated by the family fish tank filled with creatures taken from the ocean. As a teenager, her interest was heightened when she began sailing and scuba diving. The variety and vibrancy of life beneath the surface continues to be a major interest to her.\n\nWith a love for the Rockaway landscape, Hirsch says the ocean is one of the most desirable places on earth. Through Vast, she hopes to encourage viewers to acknowledge and respect the beauty of the sea and consider their own participation in the power and wholeness of the natural world.\"",

        "art_description": "In these dramatic murals the artist, Jack Beal, cleverly likens the subway to classical myths that deal with the relationship between goings-on on aboveground and below ground. \n\nTrained in art school as an abstract expressionist, Jack Beal soon turned toward figuration in his works, eventually achieving great success and becoming a leading realist.  He often stated, \u00d2I will never be satisfied until I obtain the believability of the seventeenth century Dutch painters.\u00d3    Ironically, now his interest has turned back to abstraction, he says.\n\nThe artist explains that he based this work on the Greek myth of Persephone.  In The Return of Spring mythological figure Persephone is shown running to her mother, Demeter, according to the terms of a pact Demeter had made with Hades, Persephone\u00d5s husband: Persephone would be allowed to return to earth and her mother for the rest of eternity \u00d0 provided that she ate nothing before leaving the Underworld.  But \u00d0 shades of Eve in Eden \u00d0 Persephone spied a pomegranate on the way out and could not resist taking a bite . . . \n\nThe Onset of Winter completes Beal\u00d5s story.  Persephone, having eaten the pomegranate, now is forced to renegotiate the contract.  From now on, she is allowed to spend six months on earth, but must spend the other six down below, autumn and winter in the Underworld with her husband and spring and summer aboveground with her mother \u00d0 thus the origin of the seasons.  A rueful Persephone is shown at the top of the stairs, knowing she must descend but not wanting to go. \n\nAs with Lichtenstein and Lawrence, place and time \u00d0 a particular place and a particular time, but with an implied universality \u00d0 are the theme.  Time passes, people and things come and go, but there is always a d\u017dj\u02c6 vu quality lurking just beneath the surface.",

The station is on the approximate site of a former roller coaster ride. The architect, Jim McConnell of Daniel Frankfurt, wanted to transform the exterior station walls in a unique way. Working with the architects, artist Vito Acconci developed an architectural treatment for the station fa\ufffdade that is full of life. As in successful collaborations, there is no clear delineation between the architecture and the art. \n\nBefore rehabilitation, the windscreens blocked ocean views; the new windscreens open up the platform view of the Atlantic Ocean. In the artist's words, \"The normally horizontal and vertical steel windscreen tubes and panels have been transformed into a more sinuous form that evokes the notion of a wave, or that of motion as in the Cyclone or the subway itself.\" The result is a striking and unique subway station that fits into its special surroundings.",

        "art_description": "In creating the artwork for the Dyckman Street station, Wopo Holup found inspiration in nature. Birds in Flight-Moon View consists of ceramic tile reliefs of birds in flight that were originally installed in 1991 (and titled Birds in Flight) within the white tile of the mezzanine wall and stairwells. With the opportunity presented when the station was recently rehabilitated, the artist was commissioned by MTA Arts for Transit and created white ceramic, low relief tile of the moon and earth surrounded by a white mosaic banding. The new work provides an extraordinary modern view of the earth as seen from the moonscape (from the Apollo missions). Blending with the existing station tiles, the circular shapes of the composition compliment the arched windows of the historic station and expand the view from the earlier artwork, by continuing the sky view-further up and out.\n\nIn the artist\u00d5s words, \u00d2Birds in Flight-Moon View greets customers upon entering the station and emphasizes nature and the vastness of the universe.\u00d2 Nature and biological forms of the urban landscape are brought within the interior environment of the station for the public to enjoy.",

Because the chairs look so life-like, so much like wood and upholstery fabric, they create a humorous, trompe l\u00d5oeil effect.\u00d3\n\nTo complete the domestic setting, nearby is a bronze replica of a copy of Reader\u00d5s Digest; for most of its history the magazine was published in Pleasantville.\n\nThe artists explain that Almost Home\u00d5s components were cast from six different original chairs, selected to represent different types of seating that reflect the variety of domestic d\u017dcor.  They are arranged in various clusters throughout the interior and exterior of the station overpass and waiting area.   And, for good measure, two of them are child-size.  \n\nThe process for making the chairs was intricate and painstaking.  They were cast from actual furniture, some of it antique, by using a special molding wax, with great care taken not to damage or mar the originals.  Then the castings were finished by hand to assure that each was a perfect replica.  Finally, each was given a custom finish and patination to assure that each echoes its real prototype in color as well as form.",

        "art_description": "Robert Blackburn\u00d5s creation at 116th Street and Lexington Avenue evokes the local surroundings through dynamic abstract patterns that suggests the color and movement of the streets above rather than depicting the built environment.  They bring a timeless beauty into the transit environment. \n\nOf Jamaican ancestry, Blackburn was born in Summit, New Jersey, and spent his formative years in Harlem, where he worked with renowned African American artists Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence.  A master printmaker, Blackburn was known nationally for having profoundly affected American art by refocusing attention on printmaking, in particular through his Printmaking Workshop in Harlem, which he founded in 1948.  This was particularly so in the case of abstract color lithography.  Many students fondly remember him for his influence on them as teacher and mentor.  Romare Bearden spoke for a whole generation when, in A Tribute to Robert Blackburn, he said, \u00d2One of the most outstanding facets of Robert Blackburn\u00d5s character is his desire and willingness to help the people who are working with him.\u00d3  Blackburn died in April 2003, at age eighty-two.  \n\nIn 2001, MTA Arts for Transit commissioned Blackburn to create a work for the 116th Street and Lexington Avenue subway station in Harlem.  In failing health, he chose artist Mei-Tei-Sing Smith, a Bearden Fellow at the Printmaking Workshop, to assist him on what would prove to be his last major project.  Once completed, 30-by-40-inch maquettes were sent to Germany, where they were enlarged and manufactured into large ceramic and glass mosaics that today serve as a monument to Blackburn\u00d5s bold use of color and masterful abstractions.",

The blooming plants were chosen as representation of plant species that withstand changing climate conditions of the city.\n\nSimilar to an everchanging garden, ROAMING UNDERFOOT creates a delightful place to enjoy during every season. Blum\u00d5s intent was to capture some of the magic of the nearby park, regarded as an urban sanctuary, and to enhance the station environment for transit riders.

In newly reconfigured areas of the stations Susan Tunick designed new ceramic murals and borders different from but reminiscent of the old.

        "art_description": "\u00d2Great Waves of Immigration\u00d3 by artist Carmen Lizardo invites commuters to reflect on the generations who have made New York City and the Washington Heights neighborhood home through colorful mosaic artworks at the 181 St station. A total of three murals are located within the north mezzanine, one next to the newly installed elevators and the other two on the walls above the north stairs that lead to the northbound and southbound platforms. The mosaic murals were fabricated by Mosaicos Venecianos de M\u017dxico and encompass approximately 370 square feet of wall space.\n\nLizardo\u00d5s project encapsulates the immigrant experience\u00d1leaving home, enduring the arduous journey, and eventually arriving in an unfamiliar city. With Great Waves of Immigration, the artist seeks to acknowledge the Washington Heights community\u00d5s historical migration patterns, which has given rise to its large Dominican population. She was inspired by the neighborhood\u00d5s architecture and beauty, exemplified by the iconic George Washington Bridge, images of which are superimposed and layered within the murals.\n\nJuxtaposed with these representations of iconic landmarks are portraits of the many people who travelled across vast bodies of water to settle in the area, the most recent of which include the Dominican community. Across from the turnstiles, the largest mural is divided into two parts using a yellow and gold color scheme. In the foreground is a giant overfilled yola, a Dominican boat used to make the journey over to U.S. territory. Above the downtown stairwell is a portrait of a woman holding part of a certificate of citizenship, and in the uptown stairwell is an image of an unidentified woman whose last living address was in Washington Heights. Together, these artworks remind the viewer of the diverse and ever-changing populations that have long called New York City home.",

Photographed with the artist\u00d5s deadpan sense of humor, the dogs take on human attributes, from wearing street clothes like a shiny raincoat or flannel shirt, to being grouped like passengers as they gaze into space or peer down the platform as if waiting for the train. Situated in bold blocks of color, the larger-than-life mosaic dogs are bursting into space and interacting with commuters. The mosaic fabricator, Mayer of Munich, interpreted the photographs taken for this project by meticulously transforming the facial expressions, skin textures and patterns of the dogs\u00d5 vibrant attire into glass mosaic. Wegman has lived and worked in the neighborhood for decades, and together with his dogs Flo and her brother Topper they have created images that enliven this busy station.\n\nSpeaking about the project, Wegman said, \u00d2I wanted to create portraits of individual characters, people who you might see next to you on the platform. For these I dressed the dogs in more or less ordinary clothes, nothing too fashionable. I was very interested in the way in which photographs, even the out of focus dogs in the background of some images, could be translated into mosaic by Mayer of Munich, who skillfully turned grey stones into grey dogs.\u00d3",

Captivated by the great estates and summer homes dating to the area's rural origins, the artist re-imagined the neighborhood in her mosaic artwork, building detailed 3-D replicas that served as still-life models for her painstakingly detailed paintings, from which the mosaics were interpreted. Trees, grass and a light blue sky surround the houses and neighbors may be interpreted as from the past or the present.\n\nA portion of the artwork was reconfigured in 2021 due to the ADA upgrade at the station.",

Masstransiscope turns the subway into a movie machine, presenting a colorful, animated \"moving picture\" to commuters as the train moves through the tunnel. With heavy cleaning by volunteers, the artwork became visible again in 2008. \n\nThe artwork has been viewed by millions of commuters from subway cars leaving the northbound platform of the DeKalb Avenue station on the express track. The 228 hand-painted panels are viewed through a series of vertical slits set into a specially constructed housing that runs the full 300' length of the old station. The piece works on the principle of the Zoetrope, a 19th century optical toy. \n\nThe movement of the train passing in front of the exhibition creates the illusion of a 20-second animated movie. In a regular movie the film passes through a projector to create an illusion of motion and the audience sits still. With Masstransiscope it is the audience that moves while the film stays in place.",

His tongue-in-cheek dislocations of its walls allow the curious to \u00d2see\u00d3 the stone and steel underneath.  Elsewhere, protruding and receding walls magically provide seating for people waiting for the train.  Parts of the project thrust through floors and ceilings and at one point even project aboveground.  The overall effect is as if the station has been pushed and pulled in various directions to accentuate the relationship of the building to the earth into which it has been inserted.\nThis important and complex project was one of the first truly collaborative ones to be undertaken by Arts for Transit.  The architects, diDomenico + Partners, had been given the task of redesigning the station, including the challenge of opening up the lower levels to allow light to flow through to them.  Early on, it was realized that this was the perfect opportunity for an artist to work closely with the architects.\n\nInternationally known Vito Acconci \u00d0 who had grown up in the Bronx \u00d0 was a logical choice.  Acconci has had a very active and diverse career.  He began his career as a poet and in the late 1960s and early 1970s was a well known performance artist.   In recent projects he has joined with architects and landscape designers to visualize and build ambitious constructions that meditate on and meld the meeting of private and public spaces.  At the Yankee Stadium station, his illusion of walls being opened to the outside led to the opportunity to include yet another work of art, one that would be revealed as the walls in the elevated station slid up on the ceiling and down through the floors.",

Over the pattern of shapes, it appears that a shard of light and tree silhouettes illuminate the wall. On closer inspection viewers discover that the tiles are hand-painted in ceramic glazes. This slow reveal of the image was designed by the artist, to be discovered over time, on repeated viewing, as commuters catch a glimpse of perpetual morning light. As the artist reminds us, Henry David Thoreau said: \"Vigorous thought keeps pace with the sun, the day is a perpetual morning\". The artwork may not be immediately noticed as it subtly plays with the viewer's perception of the space, and will lead to ongoing discovery and enjoyment as its mysteries are revealed.",

        "art_description": "Mary Miss is fascinated by the material remains of the recent past and takes delight in highlighting the interest of others with her observations about them.  The oldest parts of the MTA transportation system have been in existence for only a little over a century, but for Miss they provide an archaeological treasure trove.  Working with architect Lee Harris Pomeroy, she has used the old Union Square station\u00d5 s transformation into a modern and efficient transit hub, as an opportunity to explore, observe, learn, and teach.  For Miss, new construction at the site uncovered hidden wonders \u00d0 structural elements, cables, and conduits \u00d0 some of them still functional and others superseded by more modern improvements.  Also, old decorative work reappeared \u00d0 mosaics, pilasters, and name plaques \u00d0  including six eagles in terra cotta dating from the 1904 station that had been presumed destroyed.  \n\nMiss set out to share her findings with users of the station, drawing their attention to the previously hidden wonders though a network of frames, windows, apertures, and mirrors to focus viewers and then to ask them to ponder the changes that this environment has experienced over time.  The bright red frames are immediate attention-grabbers; what is framed by them may be more subtle \u00d0 a bolt, a fragment of ancient-looking mosaic, a piece of rusted steel cable.   Other frames call attention to the station\u00d5s historic name plaques.   Another framing device is a series of red slots intersected into the enameled black railings that surround above-track walkways, suggesting to travelers that a pause to look though them and downward to the tracks will provide a rewarding lesson in station design and technology.  In her words, \u00d2I\u00d5m inviting the public to look below the surface, to see a \u00d4slice\u00d5 of the station, its structure, its history.  In this most public of places, the apertures offer and intimate engagement.  Looking in, you will see the station\u00d5s workings \u00d0 sometimes you will see layers of words and reflected images, including your own!\u00d3\n\nMiss is perhaps best known for her works that blend landscape and constructed forms.  A prime example is her sinuous sculptural forms on the waterfront at South Cove in Manhattan\u00d5s Battery Park City; another is her proposal for the viewing area at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles.  As at Union Square, Miss\u00d5s sometimes enigmatic introductions into the environment tempt travelers to pay attention to things they may not have otherwise noticed.",

        "art_description": "Brooklyn, New Morning at the Broadway Junction subway station in Brooklyn consists of 75 faceted glass panels, no two alike, which are arranged into a series of murals throughout the complex as well as a seven-by-ten-foot glass mosaic mural wall.   Al Loving, who created the work, talks about the medium: \n\nFaceted glass is an opportunity to work with real light \u00c9 In ancient Chinese culture the spiral was the tip of the flame.  In contemporary time it is a symbol of continuity.  I have tried to bring a spirit of inclusiveness to this project. \n\nLoving has said of the work that it expresses a \u00d2spirit of interdependence and interconnection as an important aspect of the American experience,\u00d3 reflecting the fact that this large station is literally a cultural crossroad.  Working with natural light, the artist aims to \u00d2fuse human animism with intellectual visual consciousness.\u00d3  The overall effect of the work is to bring a new liveliness into the station; its vividly colorful and energetic forms introduce a sense of optimism and well-being.  \n\nAl Loving, a well-known African American collage artist, painter, and educator, enjoyed a long and productive career.  In 1969, his hard-edged geometric paintings in a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of Art brought him to the attention of the museum-going public.  He was fascinated with the shape of a spiral and spent much of his life exploring this form as well as inquisitively studying the properties of bright and bold colors.  Loving\u00d5s work has been described as fluid.  In 1974, in a New York Times review, he described his multi-layered, acrylic painted constructions as \u00d2dynamically composed reliefs, wall pieces that energize the space around them, seemingly almost to be caught in the act of moving across the wall.\u00d3  This dynamic quality infuses Brooklyn, New Morning as well, but this time in glass and glass mosaic.",

        "art_description": "Dom (Variations) appears as an apparition at the Fresh Pond Station \u00d0 a warm and inviting bedroom welcoming commuters to their home station. A neat bed, wallpapered wall, firm pillows and shiny furniture complete the scene. The artist\u00d5s intent is to reflect the path that flows from within the interior space of a cozy home to the exterior world, tracing the daily commute to work and the return home. Based on the concept of \u00d2home\u00d3, the mosaic mural, located across from the mezzanine entrance, depicts a lived in domestic interior scene, complete with scattered garments, books and a floor lamp. The pattern of the wallpaper on the bedroom\u00d5s back wall derives from a map, while natural elements like tree-leaves and branches invade the room \u00d0 and seem to themselves form into wallpaper. The image of a window within the mosaic emulates the real windows in the next two stations. It is an innovative use of materials, in the techniques used to print on tile and the combination of subway tile and mosaic to represent depth and texture.\n\nAt the Seneca Avenue and Forest Avenue stations, the imagery printed and hand-painted on glass, is of clothes hanging on clotheslines. Lovingly rendered, the clothing speaks to residents and domesticity, bringing a human scale to an otherwise everyday subway passage. Natural elements and branches and trees can be seen through the semi-translucent glass, echoing the imagery found within the Fresh Pond station mosaic mural. Overall, the work seeks to inspire an ethereal and dreamy atmosphere that evokes memories of the past and of a dreamed home.",

The work is based on paintings by Amy Bennett, whose artwork is based on the unique characteristics of the neighborhood's homes, which offer a glimpse into the past. Captivated by the great estates and summer homes dating to the area's rural origins, the artist re-imagined the neighborhood in her mosaic artwork, building detailed 3-D replicas that served as still-life models for her painstakingly detailed paintings, from which the mosaics were interpreted. Trees, grass and a light blue sky surround the houses and neighbors may be interpreted as from the past or the present.\n\nA portion of the artwork was reconfigured in 2021 due to the ADA upgrade at the station.",

Trees are suggested by shaped iron and guns by manipulated pieces of steel.  Light is refracted by the glass elements to powerful effect.

        "art_description": "Walter Martin and Paloma Mu\u2013oz have turned the Canal Street Station into something at first glance reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock\u00d5s The Birds.  But the birds in The Gathering are not menacing but somehow comforting.  There are dozens of them in total \u00d0 174 grackles and blackbirds, in a number of different poses, and seven crows, all cast in bronze and given a glossy black patinated coating.  They stand in groups, like people waiting in the subway, thinking, conversing, or studiedly ignoring one another.  Most of them can be found roosting on railings, watching and serving as companions to the flocks of people using the transportation system.  Birds, the artists note, are very social creatures \u00d0 just like New Yorkers; riders may find echoes of themselves and other subway travelers in their lively, cocky, quizzical interactions.\n\nCanal Street has been a commercial area for many decades.  Once primarily a warehouse district, today it is a main artery of several busy neighborhoods, long-established Little Italy and Chinatown and the newer and more hip SoHo and TriBeCa.  The street\u00d5s offerings range from Chinese delicacies, produce and herbal medicines to electronics to restaurants serving every kind of dish in every price range.  \n\nBut one thing that Canal Street largely lacks is the leavening influence of nature.  The birds of A Gathering make up for this, enlivening the space and bringing relief from the sometimes oppressive commercialism of the area.  Walter Martin and Paloma Mu\u2013oz, whose studio is in Brooklyn, have collaborated on art for many years. As part of Arts for Transit\u00d5s Lightbox Project, they installed their series of \u00d2Travelers,\u00d3 in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.  They created of 20 sculptural vignettes and photographed them to appear to be snow globes, creating magical winter wonderlands.  Part of this series traveled to the Wilshire/Normandie Metro Rail station in Los Angeles as part of Metro Arts Lightbox Series.",

The stairwells are dedicated to the artists and visionaries whose flights of creativity, as they seek sustenance for body and soul, culminate in transcendent forms that nourish the community\u00d5s consciousness and spirit.\u00d3 \n\nValerie Maynard is nationally known for her multimedia work and public art focusing on social issues.  Her work dealing with people of color has appeared abroad as well, including her representation of the United States at the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture in Nigeria in 1977.  Maynard's \"No Apartheid Anywhere\" is a particularly notable ongoing media project, which explores forms of enslavement. She was born in New York, studied printmaking at the New School, received a master\u00d5s degree in sculpture at Goddard College, and now lives in Baltimore.",

Photographed with the artist\u00d5s deadpan sense of humor, the dogs take on human attributes, from wearing street clothes like a shiny raincoat or flannel shirt, to being grouped like passengers as they gaze into space or peer down the platform as if waiting for the train. Situated in bold blocks of color, the larger-than-life mosaic dogs are bursting into space and interacting with commuters. The mosaic fabricator, Mayer of Munich, interpreted the photographs taken for this project by meticulously transforming the facial expressions, skin textures and patterns of the dogs\u00d5 vibrant attire into glass mosaic. Wegman has lived and worked in the neighborhood for decades, and together with his dogs Flo and her brother Topper they have created images that enliven this busy station.\n\nSpeaking about the project, Wegman said, \u00d2I wanted to create portraits of individual characters, people who you might see next to you on the platform. For these I dressed the dogs in more or less ordinary clothes, nothing too fashionable. I was very interested in the way in which photographs, even the out of focus dogs in the background of some images, could be translated into mosaic by Mayer of Munich, who skillfully turned grey stones into grey dogs.\u00d3",

It consists of vivid images silk-screened onto glass bricks and then joined together to form part of a colossal 370-foot Vista glass-brick wall.  In his proposal, Robert Wilson, the artist said, \u00d2I see a glass wall built as a celebration of life and joy containing all sorts of different images relating to the history of one of the greatest landmarks in the city, Coney Island.  It\u00d5s a place forever associated with optimism and entertainment and where people from all over the world gather for the same destination: fun.\u00d3\n\nThe popular image of Coney Island is of the amusement mecca where New Yorkers, before the age of air conditioning, went by the thousands to frolic in the surf and enjoy the roller coasters and other attractions.  But the neighborhood is and always has been much more than that \u00d0 a vital residential and retail area independent of the amusements.  The images of My Coney Island Baby focus on this great variety, both the recreational attractions and the people who lived, worked and played there. \n\nWilson is internationally known for his innovative projects, perhaps best for his work in experimental theater.  His formal background is in diverse disciplines; he studied painting, architecture, choreography and drama with leading teachers and practitioners in each field \u00d0 for instance, George McNeil in painting, Paolo Soleri in architecture, and George Balanchine and Martha Graham in dance.  \n\nAs light conditions change, My Coney Island Baby does as well.  It responds equally well to sunlight during the day and to artificial light at night, from both inside and outside.  In daylight, with the sun streaming in from outside, its images and colors are boldly delineated.  At nighttime it mysteriously glows from within, adding an ephemeral quality to the surroundings.  Depending on the time of day, and on light conditions, it seemingly morphs from one state to another.",

Zeller studied satellite imagery, local streets, and biological systems along the West End Line (D) and interpreted them into abstract patterns. Six drawings were recreated in luminous color in laminated glass panels installed along the platform windscreens.\n\nAs the artist\u00d5s response to the site, these colorful images have an organic quality that is in concert with the green space next to the station and the nearby bay area. In his drawings, Zeller introduces colors and curvilinear elements to the rigid structure of the elevated train line, as it sweeps through the Brooklyn terrain. Among the drawings, the satellite view of Brooklyn surrounding the Bay 50th Street station may be most recognizable in some compositions. Others reflect varying degrees of abstraction that evolved from the satellite drawing and related images. The work represents an artist keenly aware of his surroundings and who makes it his own, as he illuminates and highlights the ways in which infrastructure, nature, and human activity interact and evolve.",

        "art_description": "A glass mosaic mural installed within the mezzanine wall of the 86 St station, \"Heydays\" celebrates the past and present of Bay Ridge, which is always evolving. The work is based on paintings by Amy Bennett, whose artwork is based on the unique characteristics of the neighborhood's homes, which offer a glimpse into the past. Captivated by the great estates and summer homes dating to the area's rural origins, the artist re-imagined the neighborhood in her mosaic artwork, building detailed 3-D replicas that served as still-life models for her painstakingly detailed paintings, from which the mosaics were interpreted. Trees, grass and a light blue sky surround the houses and neighbors may be interpreted as from the past or the present.\n\nA portion of the artwork was reconfigured in 2021 due to the ADA upgrade at the station.",

The piece, \"Bronx Seasons Everchanging,\" captures the color atmospheres of annual cycles of spring, summer, fall, and winter, as well as their transitions. \n\nFabricated in glass mosaic and glazed tile by Miotto Mosaic Art Studios, the piece uses the language of geometry and color block pixilation to express rich interplays of pigment and to display formal elements of design. The combination of these components creates a vibrantly spirited, yet calming impact on the viewer. Secord aims to bring beauty, strength and inspiration from the renewal of nature\u00d5s seasons to the community of this Bronx station.",

Photographed with the artist\u00d5s deadpan sense of humor, the dogs take on human attributes, from wearing street clothes like a shiny raincoat or flannel shirt, to being grouped like passengers as they gaze into space or peer down the platform as if waiting for the train. Situated in bold blocks of color, the larger-than-life mosaic dogs are bursting into space and interacting with commuters. The mosaic fabricator, Mayer of Munich, interpreted the photographs taken for this project by meticulously transforming the facial expressions, skin textures and patterns of the dogs\u00d5 vibrant attire into glass mosaic. Wegman has lived and worked in the neighborhood for decades, and together with his dogs Flo and her brother Topper they have created images that enliven this busy station.\n\nSpeaking about the project, Wegman said, \u00d2I wanted to create portraits of individual characters, people who you might see next to you on the platform. For these I dressed the dogs in more or less ordinary clothes, nothing too fashionable. I was very interested in the way in which photographs, even the out of focus dogs in the background of some images, could be translated into mosaic by Mayer of Munich, who skillfully turned grey stones into grey dogs.\u00d3",

The imagery is highly site-specific and was chosen for its interplay of opacity and translucency.\u00d3  Pictorial elements derive from three sources, the nearby foliage, the sky, which is so much part of the experience of riding the elevated train in Brooklyn, and Coney Island\u00d5s famous Cyclone roller coaster.  \u00d2The transition from image to image mimics a camera panning from the nearby trees to the sky above and finally to the Cyclone in the distance.  For the passenger riding the F train the experience is almost cinematic.  The foliage, the clouds and the roller coaster all play with transparency; light-colored sky outlines the trestlework on the Cyclone, peeks out between the leaves, and envelops the bright white clouds.\u00d3",

People arriving in New York to start new lives, bring their language and culture with them, contributing to New York\u00d5s mosaic of cultures. The sounds of voices with different accents and dialects have their own rhythms, creating a kind of poetry in motion. To represent the unique cultural fingerprints, Lebreton selected proverbs from the various native languages to provide a sense of identity and connection. The sayings reflect peoples\u00d5 origins and also possess commonalities to all. The proverbs are paired with illustrations and create a playful interaction similar to reading a storybook.",

Tropical and North American leaves and vines are intertwined with intricate patterns and hand symbols representative of the communities in Washington Heights, incorporating healing imagery familiar to many cultures and inspiring a vision of hope for the future. Ciguapas, powerful feminine figures from Dominican folklore, join passengers on the daily commute. B\u2021ez\u00d5s art works on many levels to explore the identities of women, myth, tradition and cultural while bringing a unique perspective as a Dominican-Haitian artist.",

The work is based on paintings by Amy Bennett, whose artwork is based on the unique characteristics of the neighborhood's homes, which offer a glimpse into the past. Captivated by the great estates and summer homes dating to the area's rural origins, the artist re-imagined the neighborhood in her mosaic artwork, building detailed 3-D replicas that served as still-life models for her painstakingly detailed paintings, from which the mosaics were interpreted. Trees, grass and a light blue sky surround the houses and neighbors may be interpreted as from the past or the present.\n\nA portion of the artwork was reconfigured in 2021 due to the ADA upgrade at the station.",

The designs feature familiar objects \u00d0 sheets of paper, scaffolding, birds, trees, and foliage \u00d0 caught up in a whirlwind velocity that picks up speed and intensity as the composition unfolds throughout the station with references to energy fields and wind patterns. Each entrance features a different shade of blue and a blueprint-style vector line design, a visual theme that is integrated with the architecture, creating one of the most dynamic stations in the MTA system.\n\nSarah Sze represented the United States at the Venice Biennale in 2013, and was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2003. She has exhibited in museums worldwide, and her works are held in the permanent collections of prominent institutions, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Sze has been featured in international Biennials and has created public works for MIT, the Walker Art Center, the High Line and the Public Art Fund in New York.

        "art_description": "Mary Miss is fascinated by the material remains of the recent past and takes delight in highlighting the interest of others with her observations about them.  The oldest parts of the MTA transportation system have been in existence for only a little over a century, but for Miss they provide an archaeological treasure trove.  Working with architect Lee Harris Pomeroy, she has used the old Union Square station\u00d5 s transformation into a modern and efficient transit hub, as an opportunity to explore, observe, learn, and teach.  For Miss, new construction at the site uncovered hidden wonders \u00d0 structural elements, cables, and conduits \u00d0 some of them still functional and others superseded by more modern improvements.  Also, old decorative work reappeared \u00d0 mosaics, pilasters, and name plaques \u00d0  including six eagles in terra cotta dating from the 1904 station that had been presumed destroyed.  \n\nMiss set out to share her findings with users of the station, drawing their attention to the previously hidden wonders though a network of frames, windows, apertures, and mirrors to focus viewers and then to ask them to ponder the changes that this environment has experienced over time.  The bright red frames are immediate attention-grabbers; what is framed by them may be more subtle \u00d0 a bolt, a fragment of ancient-looking mosaic, a piece of rusted steel cable.   Other frames call attention to the station\u00d5s historic name plaques.   Another framing device is a series of red slots intersected into the enameled black railings that surround above-track walkways, suggesting to travelers that a pause to look though them and downward to the tracks will provide a rewarding lesson in station design and technology.  In her words, \u00d2I\u00d5m inviting the public to look below the surface, to see a \u00d4slice\u00d5 of the station, its structure, its history.  In this most public of places, the apertures offer and intimate engagement.  Looking in, you will see the station\u00d5s workings \u00d0 sometimes you will see layers of words and reflected images, including your own!\u00d3\n\nMiss is perhaps best known for her works that blend landscape and constructed forms.  A prime example is her sinuous sculptural forms on the waterfront at South Cove in Manhattan\u00d5s Battery Park City; another is her proposal for the viewing area at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles.  As at Union Square, Miss\u00d5s sometimes enigmatic introductions into the environment tempt travelers to pay attention to things they may not have otherwise noticed.",

        "art_description": "A Continuous Thread created by Susanna Starr was inspired by the lace doily that has particular significance to the predominantly Italian-American community in the Bensonhurst neighborhood. Lace doilies are iconic images of home. Passed from one generation to the next, connecting the past, present, and future, the colorful laces evoke home and belonging while referencing traditional handcrafts and cultures in the neighborhood such as Chinese paper cuts and Latin American textiles. Accompanying the artwork is a poem by Susan B. Auld, titled In the Shadow of the Design, which Starr considers an important element of the artwork.\n\nIn the medium of glass, each of the doilies is made up of two identical layers of brightly colored lace pattern, which were then meticulously positioned to reveal one from another. The effect of the layering adds a physical dimension and depth. The layered laces shift and change when seen from different angles, and as the light changes throughout the day. Though the images are based upon vintage lace doilies, the color combinations of the windows are graphic and modern. As a counter-balance to the landscape of the subway platforms, these large scale and at the same time, intimate domestic objects, act as visual anchors that hover delicately within the station windscreens, a continuous layering of thread.",

Storey created a series of paintings utilizing abstracted patterns and imagery that distill the essence of the distinctive attributes and qualities of the experience of riding the Sea Beach Line in Brooklyn.  \n\nStorey was inspired by the constant sequence of changes seen in the view from the subway, as well as from the perspective of the station platform. The 14 artwork panels, fabricated by Mosaika Art & Design, echo a sensory feeling of motion and sequential transition. Rendered in a bright palette and filled with contrasts of color and form, the pieces create vignettes that weave together references of backyard windows, sidewalk market displays, and juxtapose nature with the urban environment. The multi-faceted and graphic artwork is a lively, celebratory and playful experience for the passengers that use the 20 Av station.",

        "art_description": "At the Beach 44 Street station, artist Jill Parisi used the scale allowed by walls of glass block to create imaginary sea creatures. In resplendent colors and intricate patterns they appear to float on the glass. These hybrid species are inspired by an unusual marine anomaly nearby, where the Gulf Stream carries various tropical fish to the region. Parisi referenced botanical cross-sections, jellyfish, sting rays, and triggerfish, in order to create the original works on paper that were later translated into the glass medium. These over-scaled and overlapping shapes and the play of sunlight on the glass create the sensation that you are looking underwater.\n\nThe subject matter is appropriate for a station that is situated in front of the ocean, in an area discussed as a future marine preserve. The strong sunlight that reaches the southbound mezzanine fills the station as light is refracted through the glass blocks, causing the entire wall to glow. In the evening the wall is illuminated from within, providing an outdoor view of the artwork.\n\nParisi titled the work after a passage from William Carlos Williams\u00d5 prose poem, Spring and All, which contains many playful singsong lines including \u00d4coom barrooom-\u00d4, which mimics the sound of crashing waves.\n\nParisi works mostly with handmade paper, using drawing and printmaking to create large-scale installations and small sculptures. Many of her prints and drawings are delicate hand painted works inspired by organic forms. In commenting on the experience of creating this work, she said, \u00d2I am very interested in creating a feeling of lightness and beauty for the viewer. I have also wanted to work in a more permanent medium for some time, and as a result of this project I have realized that glass in very fitting for my work. It interacts beautifully with architecture and nature.\"",

I think he makes more money when he sits there.\u00d3 Elements in the design of the chair were influenced by the historic tile pattern in the station, so it nicely reiterates the credo of the original subway designers that ornamental additions to the stations should serve to make the subway a more pleasant place to be.",

        "art_description": "Nancy Holt's steel ceiling sculpture incorporating lighting at the Fulton Street and Broadway/Nassau subway station, is an example of Arts for Transit's early efforts to have the artist work closely with the architect of the station, Lee Harris Pomeroy, to integrate the artwork with the architecture.    \n\nAn environmental artist, Holt creates art by giving physical form to universal cycles of the sun, moon, and stars.  Previous work concentrating on the heavens has included her Sun Tunnels (Great Basin Desert, Utah, 1973-76), a site-specific work with four tunnels aligned to the rising and setting of the sun on the summer and winter solstices.  In the upper half of each tunnel are holes in the configuration of a constellation, the holes differing in diameter according to the magnitude of the stars they represent.  The sun, also a star, shines through the holes casting ellipses and circles of light on the bottom of the tunnels during the day.  Holt\u00d5s Dark Star Park (Rosslyn,  Arlington, Virginia, 1979-1984) is an urban renewal project consisting of pipes, tunnels, circular pools and spheres that the artist thinks of as fallen stars.\n\nIn Astral Grating, Holt has surrounded lights with graduated circular rings making domed openings in a dropped steel grate ceiling.  \"The rings and light fixtures in this ceiling light sculpture are in the configuration of the stars in five constellations: Aries, Auriga, Canis Major, Cygnus and Piscus Austrinus,\" says Holt.  The number of lights in a cluster and the diameter of the domed openings vary in size according to the brightness of the stars represented.   The heavens have thus been brought underground.\n\nAs part of the new Fulton Street Transit Center, plans are for Astral Grating to be reinstalled into the reconfigured passageways.",

        "art_description": "Riders switching subway trains at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue may find themselves suddenly surrounded by an exuberant burst of bright colors and unexpected shapes \u00d0 Elizabeth Murray\u00d5s Blooming, one of the most ambitious works of art in the MTA system, transforms a drab utilitarian space into a seemingly magical environment.  The floor-to-ceiling ceramic walls literally escape the four corners of the area to wrap around corners, sneak down steps, and ooze through doorways.  \n\nBlooming takes its title from Bloomingdale\u00d5s, the famous department store just upstairs.  The artist has called the subway a \u00d2dreamy underworld,\u00d3 a place that many riders almost sleepwalk through.  If so, Blooming is a kind of wakeup call.  All of a sudden even the most somnambulant person is confronted with startling and vivid images \u00d0 giant red womens\u00d5 shoes with whiplash laces, enormous pink tree trunks with writhing shoots and branches, and huge yellow mugs filled to the brim with purple coffee.  \n\n \u00d2After the blooming tree,\u00d3 says Murray, \u00d2I added the stepping shoes and steaming coffee cups, part of the ritual of every morning or evening subway trip.\u00d3  According to the artist, the images \u00d2stimulate thoughts about passage, as does the poetry.\u00d3  Here she is referring to William Butler Yeats\u00d5s line \u00d2In dreams begin responsibility,\u00d3 which is incorporated into the mural, as well as Gwendolyn Brooks\u00d5s \u00d2Conduct your blooming in the noise and whip of the whirlwind.\u00d3\n\nMurray says that she intended Blooming to serve as a catalyst that \u00d2provokes the imagination and make the passage brighter, more positive.\u00d3  Here the artist is following directly in the footsteps of the subway\u00d5s original decorative designers, Heins and La Farge, proponents of the City Beautiful movement, who, over a century ago, expressly set out to create art to bring out the best in human nature.",

Each horizontal, panoramic image is a single photograph shot at just the right angle and time of day.\n\n\"Push/Pull\" functions as a still moment, while also referencing the instruction for passage from one place to another. The terms \u00d2push\u00d3 and \u00d2pull\u00d3 are also commonly used by painters; planes of color push or pull the eye creating depth in a picture. Fabricated in Queens by Depp Glass, \"Push/Pull\" is a tribute to the rich social and visual tapestry of Brooklyn. Sigal acknowledged the wonderful ability of people in the city, especially subway straphangers, who are able to negotiate close spaces, coexist gracefully, and travel from place to place comfortably throughout the city.",

Zeller studied satellite imagery, local streets, and biological systems along the West End Line (D) and interpreted them into abstract patterns. Six drawings were recreated in luminous color in laminated glass panels installed along the platform windscreens.\n\nAs the artist\u00d5s response to the site, these colorful images have an organic quality that is in concert with the green space next to the station and the nearby bay area. In his drawings, Zeller introduces colors and curvilinear elements to the rigid structure of the elevated train line, as it sweeps through the Brooklyn terrain. Among the drawings, the satellite view of Brooklyn surrounding the Bay 50th Street station may be most recognizable in some compositions. Others reflect varying degrees of abstraction that evolved from the satellite drawing and related images. The work represents an artist keenly aware of his surroundings and who makes it his own, as he illuminates and highlights the ways in which infrastructure, nature, and human activity interact and evolve.",

She says of her work, \u00d2My living and my art are intertwined.  My vision is informed by family and friends, ongoing conversations, and experiences of the spirit.  This totality juxtaposes in a m\u017dlange of sights and sounds, a music that is always trying to impart a visual message that will engage the senses and hold the eyes\u00d5 intelligence, which revealing much about what is seen at any given time.\u00d3\n\nThe images of Maynard\u00d5s translucent glass mosaic are designed to \u00d2capture the boundless energy, the beacon of light that was and is our own homegrown Mecca: the Harlem of our dreams, our imaginings and our reality.  The stairwells are dedicated to the artists and visionaries whose flights of creativity, as they seek sustenance for body and soul, culminate in transcendent forms that nourish the community\u00d5s consciousness and spirit.\u00d3 \n\nValerie Maynard is nationally known for her multimedia work and public art focusing on social issues.  Her work dealing with people of color has appeared abroad as well, including her representation of the United States at the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture in Nigeria in 1977.  Maynard's \"No Apartheid Anywhere\" is a particularly notable ongoing media project, which explores forms of enslavement. She was born in New York, studied printmaking at the New School, received a master\u00d5s degree in sculpture at Goddard College, and now lives in Baltimore.",

Positioning themselves in the heads, subway riders can look out onto the world literally through the eyes of the sculptural forms.  The artist created the faces so as to be both multiethnic and androgynous, leaving room for viewers to construct for themselves stories of who these haunting forms might be and what they might signify.  The faces are constructed with steel armatures and a grid of wire mesh, which serves a protective as well as expressive function.  Also, the positioning of the forms varies from station to station, giving them further variety and expressiveness.",

        "art_description": "At the Beach 98th Street station, faceted glass artwork panels feature scenes, symbols, and the sea that surrounds the community. There are three groupings of five panels and two sets of diptychs. Artist Duke Riley has long been interested in maritime history, folklore, and local customs - particularly around New York's waterways. His work features the iconic view of the houses on stilts seen from the A train as it crosses Broad Channel. Situated on a pier, the homes are the only remaining bungalow housing pier of its kind in the City. Riley frames them with two bowline knots (a very strong knot commonly used to tie down the bow of a ship) to represent the strength and closeness within this community. Another set of five panels depicts a tugboat pulling a barge laden with recyclable glass. The tugboat was a based on a retired NYC tugboat that was docked near the artist's childhood home, and the depiction of glass in a glass artwork adds a layer of interest.\n\nRiley uses nautical flags to spell out local phrases, like the \"Be Good or Be Gone\" sign seen in local taverns and for which the series of panels is titled and uses the phrase as a reminder for visitors to take care and appreciate the fragile environment of the area. One two-panel section shows two images of a piping plover - an endangered bird that has chosen a section of beach at the Rockaways, just a few blocks south of the station, as one of its few remaining nesting grounds. The other diptych has nautical flags above images of seaside bungalows that also bear a common Rockaway phrase, \"No Sniveling,'' which simply means no whining. In the past 150 years, Rockaway Beach endured destruction from storms and fire and - as is often is the case with waterfront communities - the unwavering determination to rebuild has shaped the resilient culture of the community.On the southbound platform, a five panel set shows the rolling sea filled with cast off and floating objects and even houses, as the artist comments on both the power of the sea and the need to respect it. The faceted glass artwork fabricated by Willet Hauser Architectural Glass employs special treatments, including metal rivets to mimic ship construction, hand painting, and etching. Glass crystals form stars above the stilt houses and other innovative uses of the medium are seen throughout the works.",

Fabricated into 40 faceted glass panels, the monumental 11 feet high windows are located in the two stairwells leading from the mezzanine to the platform, filling the space with light and color.\n\nThe main characters are the sun and the moon, placed high above the Bronx cityscape with rolling hills, beautiful old apartment buildings, and green parks. Intrigued by the idea that commuters pass by the windows at different times of the day and the effect of the changing light from morning to night, Low created the artwork with the idea in mind that commuters pass by the windows at different times of the day. Light and the location became both the subject matter and focal point. The windows capture the daily light beautifully throughout the day, receiving the stronger daytime rays in the morning and the softer light in the evening hours. The colorful glass provides commuters with the opportunity to view and enjoy its effect throughout the day.\n\nLow was born and raised in the Bronx and was inspired by the station design, and incorporated elements of the original mosaic frieze into his work. The artist has fond memories of riding the subway while growing up in the Bronx.",

The artist points out, \u00d2The  Passage uses three geometric shapes \u00d0 a circle, a square, and a triangle \u00d0 that turn in four different directions.  The floor of the subway corridor is divided into large black squares.  As people walk down the passage they experience all the possible combinations of these elements.  The study of ever-changing geometric patterns comes out of  my earlier work from the 1970s that were shown in an exhibition entitled 2048 Variations on a Drawing by Malevich.  Today, I continue to work in variations of geometric shapes.  My latest pieces utilize computers to help generate large three-dimensional constructions.\u00d3",

People arriving in New York to start new lives, bring their language and culture with them, contributing to New York\u00d5s mosaic of cultures. The sounds of voices with different accents and dialects have their own rhythms, creating a kind of poetry in motion. To represent the unique cultural fingerprints, Lebreton selected proverbs from the various native languages to provide a sense of identity and connection. The sayings reflect peoples\u00d5 origins and also possess commonalities to all. The proverbs are paired with illustrations and create a playful interaction similar to reading a storybook.",

The artist created the proposal in 2004 and, working with Dattner Architects, selected the site in an expansive wall facing a double-wide stairway and landing that leads from the mezzanine to the platforms of the A, C, B, D and 1 trains. Titled Whirls and twirls (MTA), the artwork is 53 feet wide and by 11 feet high and consists of 250 porcelain tiles in six colors, each cut to meet the artist's specifications. The artist created the drawing/maquette for the project, reviewed and selected materials, and approved color samples prior to his death in 2007.\n\nThe artist is known for his sculptures and his wall drawings, in which detailed directions are provided for the execution of the artwork in paint or pencil. The site-specific piece - unique because it is a permanent public installation of a wall drawing - is a bravura work of precision, with swooping curves and vertical and horizontal bars in vibrant color that completely fills the space. The tile was cut to the exact dimensions of the drawing to ensure that the scale of the work and the color sequences are as the artist intended.\n\nSol LeWitt (1928-2007) is a celebrated artist who has had hundreds of solo exhibitions in museums and galleries worldwide since 1965. His work includes more than 1,100 wall drawings, photographs, hundreds of works on paper, and geometry-based sculptures. An exhibition at Mass MOCA in North Adams, Massachusetts, features 105 wall drawings in a specially designed museum space and will be on view through 2033.",

The stairwells are dedicated to the artists and visionaries whose flights of creativity, as they seek sustenance for body and soul, culminate in transcendent forms that nourish the community\u00d5s consciousness and spirit.\u00d3 \n\nValerie Maynard is nationally known for her multimedia work and public art focusing on social issues.  Her work dealing with people of color has appeared abroad as well, including her representation of the United States at the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture in Nigeria in 1977.  Maynard's \"No Apartheid Anywhere\" is a particularly notable ongoing media project, which explores forms of enslavement. She was born in New York, studied printmaking at the New School, received a master\u00d5s degree in sculpture at Goddard College, and now lives in Baltimore.",

Food items such as dumplings, egg tarts, kebabs, tacos, churros, borscht, and lasagna are morphed into building facades, store fronts, mailboxes, fruit stands, and subway cars. Imagery captured from the surrounding neighborhood is rendered into simplified, graphic shapes in vibrant hues.  \n\n\"Made With Love\" was translated into laminated glass panels by Glasmalerei Peters Studios and can be seen on both platforms of the station. The engaging and joyful work is meant to generate playful and whimsical responses from riders as they discover familiar elements from their cultures and communities.",

The size and density of the glass elements are gradated horizontally to simulate the movement of the trains.\n\nThe artist\u00d5s intent was to create a unique place within the neighborhood station, through the color and pattern of the work and its interactive nature, which invites travelers to look through the colored bezels or to follow the shadows they create. The composition and placement of the individual elements speak to the diversity of the surrounding multi-cultural community by emphasizing the interconnectedness of people, places, information technology and the famed A-train subway line that connects Harlem, midtown Manhattan, the Village, Brooklyn, Queens, JFK Airport and Rockaway Beaches. Waiting for the train can now include viewing the surrounding neighborhood via a filter of color and light.\n\nThe stainless steel frames were sandblasted and electro-polished to enhance the strength and specular brilliance of the stainless steel. Positioned over the roadway, the screens are visible from inside the station, on the train and outside of the station from a distance, serving as a landmark that celebrates the station\u00d5s featured role in the neighborhood.",

        "art_description": "Milton Glaser, best known for his work in graphics, printmaking, and as a teacher, was approached to augment Rolf Olhausen\u00d5s architectural plans for the restoration/ redesign of Astor Place station.  This was an interesting challenge, since the station boasted some of the most beautiful historic terra cotta and mosaics in the transportation system but at the same time required a large-scale redesign in order to make it function in today\u00d5s world.  Glaser\u00d5s response was to meld the two  \u00d0 to use the historic Grueby Faience Company plaques (which depicted beavers, a reference to the Astor fortune partly acquired though fur trading) as a springboard for his thoroughly modern design.  \n\nIn the artist\u00d5s words,\n\nThe design concept \u00c9 is basically a variation on the existing forms.  By extracting fragments of the motifs on the tile panels, enlarging their scale, and placing these pieces in a random pattern, they take on the appearance of a large puzzle.  Viewers may perceive these fragments and discover their relationship to the original design motifs.  The resulting dialectic between the previously existing and the new panels inspire an appreciation for the original details of the station.\n\nGlaser was born in New York and has often been at the very center of the city\u00d5s cultural life, for years chairing the board at New York magazine and teaching at the School of Visual Arts.  And he was especially pleased to be asked to design a work for this particular station:  \u00d2This was a wonderful commission, not only because of the proximity of Cooper Union, my alma mater, but I lived on the Lower East Side for years, and it\u00d5s good to see the old neighborhood coming back to life.\u00d3  (Interestingly, Glaser\u00d5s original design for the station included caricatures of the Astor beaver in addition to the abstract forms \u00d0 but his animals reminded community-board reviewers too much of the rats of those earlier, seedier years that they had worked so hard to eliminate!)",

Hauben commented, that as one \"looks down a long street topped by the receding concentric pattern of the elevated structure, one has a feeling of both great depth and the sprawling vastness of the city.\"",

The final result, her El View murals, skillfully transform daily goings-on into powerful images \u00d0 people arriving home from school or work, buds in the trees on a warm spring day, and lights from the businesses surrounding the elevated structures.

        "art_description": "At the SIR New Dorp station, artwork by Keri Sheheen honors the area\u00d5s natural landscapes and rich architectural history. Metal and glass panels line the walkway to the elevator on the Tottenville-bound platform, and screen-printed and hand painted art glass panels are installed on both sides of the station house portico. The installation, titled \u00d2Creeping On Where Time Has Been\u00d3, totals around 350 square feet of glass and metal artwork fabricated by Mayer of Munich and Ferra Designs, Inc.\n\nThe bold artwork is an appreciation of the borough\u00d5s historical architecture and includes imagery of notable structures such as the Vanderbilt Mausoleum and New Dorp Beach bungalows. Sheheen drew from her research of the station area with the Historic Richmond Town Archive and New York Transit Museum Archive, as well as firsthand accounts from her mother who grew up in New Dorp. Sheheen went to high school near the station and currently resides nearby.\n\nNoting the presence of ivy-covered farmhouses that date prior to the 1960s development of suburban housing in the historical photographs, Sheheen created a visual pattern to connect the window and railing designs. The artwork title, a line from the poem \u00d2The Ivy Green\u00d3 by Charles Dickens, is an allusion to the ivy motif that symbolizes the persistence of time and nature\u00d5s substantial presence on Staten Island despite manmade developments.\n\nA suite of nine cut metal panels lines the walkway to the new elevator on the Tottenville-bound side of the station and features blue, yellow, and red glass squares lining the top and bottom of the panels. The colorful border is also seen on the laminated glass panels of the station porticoes and references the stained glass of the original 1889 station house, which was relocated to Historic Richmond Town in 1965. In the metal design, the ivy motif is a backdrop to stylized beach bungalows alluding to New Dorp\u00d5s past as a turn-of- the-twentieth-century beach resort destination. Sheheen based the bungalow representations on historic buildings such as the Lang's Hotel, the Elm Tree Lighthouse, the Munger on the Beach Hotel, and the Cedar Grove Clubhouse.\n\nThe St. George-bound side of the station portico features a towering rooster in a nod to the farmland that once stretched across the neighborhood and acts as a greeter for morning commuters. The rooster stands over Britton Cottage, originally on New Dorp Lane, which was home to famous botanist Nathanial Lord Britton, founder of the New York Botanical Garden. It is one of the oldest structures on Staten Island and was also moved to Historic Richmond town.\n\nOn the Tottenville-bound side is a serene evening scene for commuters returning home. A deer, common on Staten Island, stands over an illustration of the Vanderbilt Mausoleum located in nearby Moravian Cemetery. Cornelius Vanderbilt owned the New York Central Railroad and one of the first ferry services from Staten Island to Manhattan, indelible contributions to the daily commute of Staten Islanders.",

Each unique drawing takes reference from the geographic location of the station as well as its cartographic relation to the city\u00d5s transportation network. For example, the path the F train takes through the city and it's many stops, satellite imagery, maps, and other locations specific to the Avenue X station, were the artist\u00d5s starting points. The lyrical and intricately drawn AVEX1-6(station) is an allusion to mass transit as the circulatory system for our city and conveys an ever-changing, diverse and evolving metropolis. As artworks, the piercing blue and white drawings bring visual interest to the experience of this station in Gravesend, Brooklyn.",

Resonating with the landscape of the neighborhood, the vibrant, whimsical arrangements interact with the bright, open sky and the natural light. The rigid lines and square structures, on the southbound platform, are reflective of the buildings and the journey towards Manhattan, while the curved lines and circular motifs, on the northbound platform, are symbolic of nature and Pelham Bay. Miotto Mosaic Art Studio interpreted her original design into the finished panels. For the project, Soonae Tark chose bright, primary colors as forms of expression, similarly to many cultures of people. Through the contrasting configurations, Soonae seeks to inspire commuters and the people of the neighborhood with positive energy and uplifting feelings. The work, with a universal appeal, was designed for all who travel the subway and use this station.",

        "art_description": "Brooklyn-based artist Julien Gardair created We are each others for the Kings Highway and 18th Avenue Stations. The artwork depicts figural sculptures with seating elements and whimsical surface design on windscreen panels. Figures from local history as well as present-day residents were the inspiration for the stainless steel sculptures. The artist refers to the early days of the area such as the arrival of European settlers and the foundation of the Culver train line at the turn of the 20th century bringing an expansion of residents in South Brooklyn. This series of joyful sculptures also captures themes of family life and resourcefulness in the neighborhood. For the windscreen panels, the artist utilized a single design to create multiple unique compositions arranged in different configurations. The positive and negative shapes of the design mirror each other from across the platform at each station. Gardair created all of the artwork with a no-waste design framework which relates to the future of the neighborhood and the environmental impact of all of New York City. Passengers will travel through time and imagination on their commute when experiencing Julien Gardair\u00d5s We are each others artwork at these two Culver Line Stations.",

As parts of the building are enhanced by diamond-shaped tiles, so are the patterns on the optical panels based upon the diamond shape. The vibrancy of movement and the patterns in the panels creates a visual dialogue between the Arts and Crafts style, the motion of the trains, and the high-tech world of today\u00c9  For the people who take the time to look, this installation becomes a moving exhibition.\u00d3",

They are the inspiration for Everet\u00d5s artwork, A Portrayal of Life at Mill Creek. Everet created a series of stainless steel artwork panels that represent species of wildlife supported in local habitats.\n\nThe artist presents varying combinations of animal, insect and plant species within each panel design. The Common Snapping Turtle, known to nest in the area, is paired with the Indian Tobacco Plant which is named for the tobacco-like scent of its small ornate flowers. The naturalized Climbing Nightshade Vine, with its dangling star-like flowers and red berries is coupled with the Appalachian Brook Crayfish, whose chimney like openings occasionally protrude from a network of tunnels along the banks of the creek. The Calico Pennant Dragonfly, endowed by nature with red heart-shaped spots is complemented with tall colonies of Common Cattail, that are known for their dense cylindrical flowers. The Yellow Trout Lily, which appears briefly in spring, is combined with the Morning Cicada, which is named for its singing from morning to midday.\n\nMany of the plants and animals in the local ecosystem have nurtured each other and served as a source of food and medicine for humans. A decline in quality or loss of habitat can threaten the future of inhabitants in this ecosystem. With this artwork, the artist hopes to raise awareness of and appreciation for the rich local wildlife of this Staten Island community.",

His tightly cropped paintings take cues from daily visual culture like advertising and cinema, celebrating everyday America. The large painted glass panels, fabricated by Glasmalerei Peters Studios, fill the passageway with light and color through the faces that reflect those of commuters, while his lush floral compositions are a nod to nearby Central Park.\n\nCommenting on the public permanent installation, the artist and subway rider said, \"It is a privilege to make art for all people.\" The lengthy station mezzanine, which was constructed in the late 1960s and designed with the commercial development above, provides a unique setting within the transit environment to view the series of paintings on glass that are set within the cast stone panels that line the station walls.",

        "art_date": "2001",
        "art_material": "Glass Mosaic",
        "art_description": "In these dramatic murals the artist, Jack Beal, cleverly likens the subway to classical myths that deal with the relationship between goings-on on aboveground and below ground. \n\nTrained in art school as an abstract expressionist, Jack Beal soon turned toward figuration in his works, eventually achieving great success and becoming a leading realist.  He often stated, \u00d2I will never be satisfied until I obtain the believability of the seventeenth century Dutch painters.\u00d3    Ironically, now his interest has turned back to abstraction, he says.\n\nThe artist explains that he based this work on the Greek myth of Persephone.  In The Return of Spring mythological figure Persephone is shown running to her mother, Demeter, according to the terms of a pact Demeter had made with Hades, Persephone\u00d5s husband: Persephone would be allowed to return to earth and her mother for the rest of eternity \u00d0 provided that she ate nothing before leaving the Underworld.  But \u00d0 shades of Eve in Eden \u00d0 Persephone spied a pomegranate on the way out and could not resist taking a bite . . . \n\nThe Onset of Winter completes Beal\u00d5s story.  Persephone, having eaten the pomegranate, now is forced to renegotiate the contract.

The portraits feature renowned figures of history and culture, sourced from photographs and translated into glass mosaic. Beacons is a celebration of the energy and spirit of individuals who have been influential within the Bronx community and have received positive acclaim for their cultural, political and artistic contributions.\n\nThe eight figures highlighted in Gatson\u00d5s artwork include Gil Scott-Heron, Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, Audre Lorde, James Baldwin, Maya Angelou, Reggie Jackson and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Gatson juxtaposes the black and white portraits with hard-edge geometric lines using a palette of red, orange, yellow, black, grey, and green, which act as a metaphor for beaming light.\n\nThe portraits radiate with beauty and pride of these influential figures, and invite travelers to reflect on the past as well as find inspiration for the future. The station\u00d5s mosaic murals are an extension of Gatson\u00d5s earlier \u00d2Icons\u00d3 series, showing new ways to present biography and photography in a contemporary, bold and graphic way. Gatson\u00d5s artwork reveals a mix of influences -- performance, conceptualism, minimalism and constructivism, to name a few-- which are combined with an interest in history and representation.\n\nSouthbound platform artwork credits (L to R)\n\nGil Scott-Heron portrait derived from a photograph by Paul Natkin\n\nAudre Lorde portrait derived from a photograph by Jack Mitchell\n\nCelia Cruz portrait derived from a photograph owned by Celia Cruz Entertainment LLC\n\nJames Baldwin portrait derived from a photograph by Steve Schapiro\n\nNorthbound platform artwork credits (L to R)\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor portrait derived from a photograph by Timothy Greenfield-Sanders\n\nReggie Jackson portrait derived from a photograph by Doug McWilliams/ National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\n\nTito Puente portrait derived from a photograph by Martin Cohen\n\nMaya Angelou portrait derived from a photograph by Brian Lanker.",

DeBorah Goletz fancifully cut out the couples\u00d5 faces, allowing people to \u00d2stick their heads through for souvenir photos, just like the old boardwalk props,\u00d3 she says.  Inside the station is a second mural of turn-of-the-century people, and two smaller ones capture quiet moments on the bay.  Goletz, a superb ceramicist, created an Escher-like pattern of tiles, with color gradations from green to blue and back to green.  The results are rhythmic patterns that make one \u00d2feel\u00d3 the water itself.",

        "art_description": "Walter Martin and Paloma Mu\u2013oz have turned the Canal Street Station into something at first glance reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock\u00d5s The Birds.  But the birds in The Gathering are not menacing but somehow comforting.  There are dozens of them in total \u00d0 174 grackles and blackbirds, in a number of different poses, and seven crows, all cast in bronze and given a glossy black patinated coating.  They stand in groups, like people waiting in the subway, thinking, conversing, or studiedly ignoring one another.  Most of them can be found roosting on railings, watching and serving as companions to the flocks of people using the transportation system.  Birds, the artists note, are very social creatures \u00d0 just like New Yorkers; riders may find echoes of themselves and other subway travelers in their lively, cocky, quizzical interactions.\n\nCanal Street has been a commercial area for many decades.  Once primarily a warehouse district, today it is a main artery of several busy neighborhoods, long-established Little Italy and Chinatown and the newer and more hip SoHo and TriBeCa.  The street\u00d5s offerings range from Chinese delicacies, produce and herbal medicines to electronics to restaurants serving every kind of dish in every price range.  \n\nBut one thing that Canal Street largely lacks is the leavening influence of nature.  The birds of A Gathering make up for this, enlivening the space and bringing relief from the sometimes oppressive commercialism of the area.  Walter Martin and Paloma Mu\u2013oz, whose studio is in Brooklyn, have collaborated on art for many years. As part of Arts for Transit\u00d5s Lightbox Project, they installed their series of \u00d2Travelers,\u00d3 in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.  They created of 20 sculptural vignettes and photographed them to appear to be snow globes, creating magical winter wonderlands.  Part of this series traveled to the Wilshire/Normandie Metro Rail station in Los Angeles as part of Metro Arts Lightbox Series.",

A terrazzo paver marks the spot of the northern most point of the A line, and metallic silver Murano mosaics compose the large letters that also remind you that you of this place of arrival and departure..   Next you encounter white-glazed ceramic tiles which comment on the experience of recent immigrants to New York,  and on the elevator wall are figures depicted from various present-day Latino civilizations \u00d0 including a \u00d2Moco Jumbie\u00d3 stilt dancer and an unorthodox-looking Uncle Sam.  Lastly, there is a motif of flute-playing figures in terrazzo pavers on the mezzanine that comment on the role of music in the community.  \u00d2Musical history resonates here,\u00d3 she says, \u00d2it is the soul of this community.\u00d3  She highlights this by etching the words from Billy Strayhorn\u00d5s \u00d2Take the A Train\u00d3 on the stainless steel railing of the mezzanine stairwell. \n\nde Bretteville\u00d5s work celebrates the composition and history of the multinational community in and around Inwood, at the northern tip of Manhattan \u00d0 its multiple generations of immigrants culminating in today\u00d5s new settlers and their Caribbean heritage.\n\nIn her proposal for the Inwood project, de Bretteville says,\n \u00d2in each of my projects I have looked for what elements could make the \u00d4hereness\u00d5 of the site significant.  I try to seek out aspects of the history of the particular site that could reflect the views and experiences of citizens living and working there in the past, present and hopefully what is there will also be resonant with those who live and work there in the future. Talking with members of the various adjacent communities and reading various histories of the area guides, my choice of images and stories and hopefully insures a vital connection of people to place. I particularly enjoy imagining what could enhance a particular site, the alchemy by which the various images and pieces of texts reveal a hidden history, the plurality of voices reveal agencies and knowledge different from mine at the same time that I too am myself reflected in the experience.\u00d3\n\nSince the late 1980s, de Bretteville has created public works \u00d0 in concrete, stone, steel, brass and other materials \u00d0 in cities all over the country, including Boston, New Haven, and Los Angeles.  All of these are site-specific, involving local communities and their histories.  She also has worked extensively in graphics, designing publications on art and culture and fine press art editions.",

        "art_description": "Dom (Variations) appears as an apparition at the Fresh Pond Station \u00d0 a warm and inviting bedroom welcoming commuters to their home station. A neat bed, wallpapered wall, firm pillows and shiny furniture complete the scene. The artist\u00d5s intent is to reflect the path that flows from within the interior space of a cozy home to the exterior world, tracing the daily commute to work and the return home. Based on the concept of \u00d2home\u00d3, the mosaic mural, located across from the mezzanine entrance, depicts a lived in domestic interior scene, complete with scattered garments, books and a floor lamp. The pattern of the wallpaper on the bedroom\u00d5s back wall derives from a map, while natural elements like tree-leaves and branches invade the room \u00d0 and seem to themselves form into wallpaper. The image of a window within the mosaic emulates the real windows in the next two stations. It is an innovative use of materials, in the techniques used to print on tile and the combination of subway tile and mosaic to represent depth and texture.\n\nAt the Seneca Avenue and Forest Avenue stations, the imagery printed and hand-painted on glass, is of clothes hanging on clotheslines. Lovingly rendered, the clothing speaks to residents and domesticity, bringing a human scale to an otherwise everyday subway passage. Natural elements and branches and trees can be seen through the semi-translucent glass, echoing the imagery found within the Fresh Pond station mosaic mural. Overall, the work seeks to inspire an ethereal and dreamy atmosphere that evokes memories of the past and of a dreamed home.",

This concordance of Rights and Declarations creates an immersive environment to be experienced by riders as they pass along the station\u00d5s platform walls.\n\nCHORUS spans a total of 4,350 square feet and is integrated into the architectural design of the WTC Cortlandt station and the World Trade Center PATH transit hub to which it is connected. The artwork was created as the result of close collaboration between Ann Hamilton, typographic designer Hans Cogne, and skilled mosaic artisans at Mayer of Munich. Set in monochromatic marble mosaic, the woven text forms a white-on-white tactile surface framing the subway platforms and the movement of citizens throughout the site. The tactile surface invites subway riders to touch the text as they read the words, creating meaningful personal encounters meant to acknowledge the civic ideals and aspirations that form the foundation for the quality of life above.\n\nAnn Hamilton is internationally recognized for her large-scale mixed-media installations. Noted for a dense accumulation of materials, her ephemeral environments create immersive experiences that poetically respond to the architectural presence and social history of their sites. Hamilton is a MacArthur and a Guggenheim fellow. She won the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture, and represented the United States in the 1991 Sao Paulo Bienal, and the 1999 Venice Biennale. In 2015, Hamilton was honored with The National Medal of Arts, the highest award given to artists by the US government.",

The art crowns the station and features overlapping mandala-like circles and patterns against a cobalt blue background. In the upper right a sun-like form emits rays of color bands. Starbursts of bright light appear through the blue background. The glass mosaic artwork is vibrant, joyous and rich with pattern and texture and among the largest in Arts & Design\u00d5s collection of commissioned works in the MTA transit network.\n\nInside the station mezzanine, the curved recessed ceiling dome contains glittering mosaics, also set against a deep blue background with repeating mandalas and patterns. Xenobia Bailey is a fiber artist who works primarily in crochet and textiles, creating sculptural work and textiles with an architectural harmony that celebrates her materials and forms. Her art for the station began as crocheted pieces, which were transferred to digital images, enlarged and interpreted into mosaic by Miotto Mosaic Art Studio.\n\nBailey sees the work as speaking to the universal idea of creation and has created artwork that vibrates with energy. She refers to her accumulation of materials as in the tradition of African-American art\u00d1reflected in the music of the 60\u00d5s she grew up with\u00d1and its material culture and design, where one made do with what was available, and made it into something new and wonderful.\n\nA third mosaic will be suspended above an adjacent station entrance when it is complete.",

        "art_material": "Glass mosaic",
        "art_description": "At the Avenue U station, on the Sea Beach line, Brooklyn-based artist Sally Gil created a series of fourteen mosaics entitled Edges of a South Brooklyn Sky. Reflecting on the Gravesend neighborhood where the Avenue U station is located, Gil used her poetic style to re-interpret and re-situate recognizable places and objects found throughout the area. Each of the fourteen mosaic panels whimsically represents Gravesend, and the diverse communities living there past and present. \n\nThere are seven mosaics on each of the station\u00d5s platforms, each containing a roving skyline and depicting familiar structures and things, such as Italian rainbow cookies, a quail egg, a Mexican Concha cookie, railroad tracks, and even the station house at the Avenue U subway entrance. Local architectural structures are placed close to the center line of all fourteen mosaics, because, as Gil says, \u00d2the horizon line is where the business of living happens.\u00d3 Concurrently the myriad objects, representing the rich social texture of the multiethnic Gravesend community, float amidst the day and night skies. This is where, as Gil says, \u00d2the internal life lives, all the complex and mystifying contemplations that move us.\u00d3 The day and night skies are reversed in form and concept across the platforms, helping to situate daily commuters in time and space, as they leave from and arrive back to the Avenue U station. \n\nSally Gil uses painting and mixed media collage to make her artworks. For the Avenue U station, her fourteen, original mixed media pieces were fabricated in glass mosaic by Mosaicos Venezianos de M\u017dxico. Gil worked closely the mosaicists to replicate her small scale works into the fourteen large scale mosaic murals now permanently located along the platforms. As riders move through the Edges of a South Brooklyn Sky, artist Sally Gil reminds us that, \u00d2every day we are making our place in the world, and the subway is the conduit that transports us. We live on a physical plane, while dwelling in our thoughts and imaginations -- the world of our own stories. Ultimately I believe, although from differing places, we all want the same things: To live peacefully, with what we need and want\".",

They bring a timeless beauty into the transit environment. \n\nOf Jamaican ancestry, Blackburn was born in Summit, New Jersey, and spent his formative years in Harlem, where he worked with renowned African American artists Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence.  A master printmaker, Blackburn was known nationally for having profoundly affected American art by refocusing attention on printmaking, in particular through his Printmaking Workshop in Harlem, which he founded in 1948.  This was particularly so in the case of abstract color lithography.  Many students fondly remember him for his influence on them as teacher and mentor.  Romare Bearden spoke for a whole generation when, in A Tribute to Robert Blackburn, he said, \u00d2One of the most outstanding facets of Robert Blackburn\u00d5s character is his desire and willingness to help the people who are working with him.\u00d3  Blackburn died in April 2003, at age eighty-two.  \n\nIn 2001, MTA Arts for Transit commissioned Blackburn to create a work for the 116th Street and Lexington Avenue subway station in Harlem.  In failing health, he chose artist Mei-Tei-Sing Smith, a Bearden Fellow at the Printmaking Workshop, to assist him on what would prove to be his last major project.  Once completed, 30-by-40-inch maquettes were sent to Germany, where they were enlarged and manufactured into large ceramic and glass mosaics that today serve as a monument to Blackburn\u00d5s bold use of color and masterful abstractions.",

Photographed with the artist\u00d5s deadpan sense of humor, the dogs take on human attributes, from wearing street clothes like a shiny raincoat or flannel shirt, to being grouped like passengers as they gaze into space or peer down the platform as if waiting for the train. Situated in bold blocks of color, the larger-than-life mosaic dogs are bursting into space and interacting with commuters. The mosaic fabricator, Mayer of Munich, interpreted the photographs taken for this project by meticulously transforming the facial expressions, skin textures and patterns of the dogs\u00d5 vibrant attire into glass mosaic. Wegman has lived and worked in the neighborhood for decades, and together with his dogs Flo and her brother Topper they have created images that enliven this busy station.\n\nSpeaking about the project, Wegman said, \u00d2I wanted to create portraits of individual characters, people who you might see next to you on the platform. For these I dressed the dogs in more or less ordinary clothes, nothing too fashionable. I was very interested in the way in which photographs, even the out of focus dogs in the background of some images, could be translated into mosaic by Mayer of Munich, who skillfully turned grey stones into grey dogs.\u00d3",

In newly reconfigured areas of the stations Susan Tunick designed new ceramic murals and borders different from but reminiscent of the old.  The leaf motifs of these works derive, she says, from childhood memories of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and Prospect Park, both nearby, as well as her longstanding interest in ceramic history and modern artistic expressions in fired clay.  Tunick has long been involved as a leader of Friends of Terra Cotta where she has successfully crusaded in New York and nationally to save and restore ceramic architectural forms on significant buildings and monuments.",

The artist refers to the early days of the area such as the arrival of European settlers and the foundation of the Culver train line at the turn of the 20th century bringing an expansion of residents in South Brooklyn. This series of joyful sculptures also captures themes of family life and resourcefulness in the neighborhood. For the windscreen panels, the artist utilized a single design to create multiple unique compositions arranged in different configurations. The positive and negative shapes of the design mirror each other from across the platform at each station. Gardair created all of the artwork with a no-waste design framework which relates to the future of the neighborhood and the environmental impact of all of New York City. Passengers will travel through time and imagination on their commute when experiencing Julien Gardair\u00d5s We are each others artwork at these two Culver Line Stations.",

        "art_description": "Nancy Holt's steel ceiling sculpture incorporating lighting at the Fulton Street and Broadway/Nassau subway station, is an example of Arts for Transit's early efforts to have the artist work closely with the architect of the station, Lee Harris Pomeroy, to integrate the artwork with the architecture.    \n\nAn environmental artist, Holt creates art by giving physical form to universal cycles of the sun, moon, and stars.  Previous work concentrating on the heavens has included her Sun Tunnels (Great Basin Desert, Utah, 1973-76), a site-specific work with four tunnels aligned to the rising and setting of the sun on the summer and winter solstices.  In the upper half of each tunnel are holes in the configuration of a constellation, the holes differing in diameter according to the magnitude of the stars they represent.  The sun, also a star, shines through the holes casting ellipses and circles of light on the bottom of the tunnels during the day.  Holt\u00d5s Dark Star Park (Rosslyn,  Arlington, Virginia, 1979-1984) is an urban renewal project consisting of pipes, tunnels, circular pools and spheres that the artist thinks of as fallen stars.\n\nIn Astral Grating, Holt has surrounded lights with graduated circular rings making domed openings in a dropped steel grate ceiling.  \"The rings and light fixtures in this ceiling light sculpture are in the configuration of the stars in five constellations: Aries, Auriga, Canis Major, Cygnus and Piscus Austrinus,\" says Holt.  The number of lights in a cluster and the diameter of the domed openings vary in size according to the brightness of the stars represented.   The heavens have thus been brought underground.\n\nAs part of the new Fulton Street Transit Center, plans are for Astral Grating to be reinstalled into the reconfigured passageways.",

Sourcing decorative patterns commonly seen in American pressed glass, milk glass, cut glass, Depression glass, and carnival glass, Lynch transformed these elements into kaleidoscopic abstractions for the platform windscreens. Fabricated by Peters Glass, the resulting work in six sets of bold and vibrant compositions represents the people of the community, as well as the promising lifestyle desired by those who settled in the neighborhood the station serves.",

The southbound side of the station faces the ocean and has the brightest light and contains two large panels with larger than life-size figures filling the space amid the cool blue of the ocean. On the northbound side, the glass block contains a sequence of smaller vignettes that extend from sand to the sea in one long band. The view of the sequence depends upon the transit riders\u00d5 path going up to or down from the elevated platform.\n\nThe artwork was created in glass block which is located in the mezzanine area which is above the street and below the platform. The fabrication technique echoed Levenson\u00d5s brushwork, with hand painting of the individual half-blocks, which were then laminated to clear blocks. The resulting work is durable and allows light to come though. In the evening the illuminated interiors will light the work so it can be seen by those approaching the station.\n\nThe figures \u00d0many are children with their mothers- are seen in free and unguarded moments of delight that often comes as the sand meets the surf. Levenson has long painted such beach scenes and speaks of his childhood memories at the beach, \u00d2where life\u00d5s greatest and smallest dramas play out on a daily basis.\"",

Captivated by the great estates and summer homes dating to the area's rural origins, the artist re-imagined the neighborhood in her mosaic artwork, building detailed 3-D replicas that served as still-life models for her painstakingly detailed paintings, from which the mosaics were interpreted. Trees, grass and a light blue sky surround the houses and neighbors may be interpreted as from the past or the present.\n\nA portion of the artwork was reconfigured in 2021 due to the ADA upgrade at the station.",

While most neighborhoods are filled with flower shops, they are particularly spectacular on the Upper East Side, where they can command a pretty penny for their wares.  Kushner\u00d5s imagery captures the essence of a spring day.  Flowers are associated with many of the institutions in the neighborhood above \u00d0 hospitals, parks, and museums.  \n\nA painter, sculptor and printmaker, Kushner has always been fascinated by organic motifs.  He achieved fame in the 1970s for his forays into performance art, in which he often appeared in bizarre vegetable costumes, which many found the highlight of the performance.  A founder of the Pattern and Decoration Movement, he continues to feature vegetal motifs in his works, often along with geometric patterns and architectural shapes.  His work is clearly influenced by Chinese and Japanese art, in both subject matter and composition, and is also inspired by European and American artists such as Henri Matisse, Pierre Bonnard, Odilon Redon, and Georgia O\u00d5Keeffe.  \n\nThe artist has a special affinity for the Upper East Side neighborhood where his work appears: \u00d2This subway station is quite familiar to me \u00d0 serving the Whitney Museum, the Metropolitan Museum, and also Lenox Hill Hospital (where all three of my children were born).  I feel these cumulative experiences have directly influenced my thoughts about what I would like to look at when entering the station.  My intention is for people to enter the station, pass through the turnstile, look up and take note, and then go on with their day feeling a little lighter, having glimpsed something beautiful for a passing moment.\u00d3 \u00d2As people come and go from this stop, either to their job, home, Lenox Hill Hospital, Central Park, or the museums in the neighborhood, either recreation, culture, work or healing are often on people\u00d5s minds. Flowers can be associated with all of these activities and become particularly apt subject matter for this station. \u00d2",

How a work of public art is integrated into its site and the interplay of ideas with the use of the site are of primary importance.   I like to think about how people will participate with the work, how they will move by, around, through or over it.   With this movement in mind I have made works using several sculptural elements linking areas of a site into a single concept.  I looked at the station \u00d5s existing tile frieze and continued the frieze as a relief tile band.   The relief shows a flight of birds \u00d0 gold when they fly through the gold band and white as they travel over the white tile of the stairwells. I thought of the birds as flying along with the people as both ascend the stairs to the train's elevated platform.\u00d3"

        "art_description": "Nancy Holt's steel ceiling sculpture incorporating lighting at the Fulton Street and Broadway/Nassau subway station, is an example of Arts for Transit's early efforts to have the artist work closely with the architect of the station, Lee Harris Pomeroy, to integrate the artwork with the architecture.    \n\nAn environmental artist, Holt creates art by giving physical form to universal cycles of the sun, moon, and stars.  Previous work concentrating on the heavens has included her Sun Tunnels (Great Basin Desert, Utah, 1973-76), a site-specific work with four tunnels aligned to the rising and setting of the sun on the summer and winter solstices.  In the upper half of each tunnel are holes in the configuration of a constellation, the holes differing in diameter according to the magnitude of the stars they represent.  The sun, also a star, shines through the holes casting ellipses and circles of light on the bottom of the tunnels during the day.  Holt\u00d5s Dark Star Park (Rosslyn,  Arlington, Virginia, 1979-1984) is an urban renewal project consisting of pipes, tunnels, circular pools and spheres that the artist thinks of as fallen stars.\n\nIn Astral Grating, Holt has surrounded lights with graduated circular rings making domed openings in a dropped steel grate ceiling.  \"The rings and light fixtures in this ceiling light sculpture are in the configuration of the stars in five constellations: Aries, Auriga, Canis Major, Cygnus and Piscus Austrinus,\" says Holt.  The number of lights in a cluster and the diameter of the domed openings vary in size according to the brightness of the stars represented.   The heavens have thus been brought underground.\n\nAs part of the new Fulton Street Transit Center, plans are for Astral Grating to be reinstalled into the reconfigured passageways.",

Trees are suggested by shaped iron and guns by manipulated pieces of steel.  Light is refracted by the glass elements to powerful effect.

Zeller studied satellite imagery, local streets, and biological systems along the West End Line (D) and interpreted them into abstract patterns. Six drawings were recreated in luminous color in laminated glass panels installed along the platform windscreens.\n\nAs the artist\u00d5s response to the site, these colorful images have an organic quality that is in concert with the green space next to the station and the nearby bay area. In his drawings, Zeller introduces colors and curvilinear elements to the rigid structure of the elevated train line, as it sweeps through the Brooklyn terrain. Among the drawings, the satellite view of Brooklyn surrounding the Bay 50th Street station may be most recognizable in some compositions.

        "art_description": "A Continuous Thread created by Susanna Starr was inspired by the lace doily that has particular significance to the predominantly Italian-American community in the Bensonhurst neighborhood. Lace doilies are iconic images of home. Passed from one generation to the next, connecting the past, present, and future, the colorful laces evoke home and belonging while referencing traditional handcrafts and cultures in the neighborhood such as Chinese paper cuts and Latin American textiles. Accompanying the artwork is a poem by Susan B. Auld, titled In the Shadow of the Design, which Starr considers an important element of the artwork.\n\nIn the medium of glass, each of the doilies is made up of two identical layers of brightly colored lace pattern, which were then meticulously positioned to reveal one from another. The effect of the layering adds a physical dimension and depth. The layered laces shift and change when seen from different angles, and as the light changes throughout the day. Though the images are based upon vintage lace doilies, the color combinations of the windows are graphic and modern. As a counter-balance to the landscape of the subway platforms, these large scale and at the same time, intimate domestic objects, act as visual anchors that hover delicately within the station windscreens, a continuous layering of thread.",

        "art_description": "Walter Martin and Paloma Mu\u2013oz have turned the Canal Street Station into something at first glance reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock\u00d5s The Birds.  But the birds in The Gathering are not menacing but somehow comforting.  There are dozens of them in total \u00d0 174 grackles and blackbirds, in a number of different poses, and seven crows, all cast in bronze and given a glossy black patinated coating.  They stand in groups, like people waiting in the subway, thinking, conversing, or studiedly ignoring one another.  Most of them can be found roosting on railings, watching and serving as companions to the flocks of people using the transportation system.  Birds, the artists note, are very social creatures \u00d0 just like New Yorkers; riders may find echoes of themselves and other subway travelers in their lively, cocky, quizzical interactions.\n\nCanal Street has been a commercial area for many decades.  Once primarily a warehouse district, today it is a main artery of several busy neighborhoods, long-established Little Italy and Chinatown and the newer and more hip SoHo and TriBeCa.  The street\u00d5s offerings range from Chinese delicacies, produce and herbal medicines to electronics to restaurants serving every kind of dish in every price range.  \n\nBut one thing that Canal Street largely lacks is the leavening influence of nature.  The birds of A Gathering make up for this, enlivening the space and bringing relief from the sometimes oppressive commercialism of the area.  Walter Martin and Paloma Mu\u2013oz, whose studio is in Brooklyn, have collaborated on art for many years. As part of Arts for Transit\u00d5s Lightbox Project, they installed their series of \u00d2Travelers,\u00d3 in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.  They created of 20 sculptural vignettes and photographed them to appear to be snow globes, creating magical winter wonderlands.  Part of this series traveled to the Wilshire/Normandie Metro Rail station in Los Angeles as part of Metro Arts Lightbox Series.",

Miotto Mosaic Art Studios translated Fordjour\u00d5s layered surfaces into glass and ceramic mosaic, capturing the collage process inherent in his work. Based on his richly textured paintings created with humble materials such as newspaper, oil pastels, and charcoal, lines of drum majors, majorettes, dancers, and drummers joyfully parade along the platforms, and are accompanied by crowds of people and flags.\n\nFrom his historic research into the neighborhood, the artist touches on the legacy of parades through Harlem starting with the Harlem Hellfighters 369th Regiment in 1919 after WWI, through to the African American Day Parade founded during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s and continuing today. Fordjour\u00d5s artwork provides riders with a chance to encounter a celebration of community, history, and identity in the colorful art that complements the station\u00d5s improvements and reinforces the historic fabric of the station.\n\nDerek Fordjour is a Harlem-based artist of African-American heritage. In his richly textured paintings, the artist draws upon a variety of sources including sporting imagery, board games, and carnival motifs to explore ideas of vulnerability, aspiration, and structures of fairness. He has recently held residencies at the Sugar Hill Museum and the Sharpe-Walentas Studio Program, and was awarded the 2018 Deutsche Bank NYFA Fellowship Award. He is a graduate of Morehouse College, earned graduate degrees in Art Education from Harvard University, and painting from Hunter College.",

The final product, in faceted-glass, captivates the viewer\u00d5s attention with interlocking streams of colors.  Fabricated into 20 panels and placed on the subway platform for the public to enjoy from inside as well as outside the station, the  work is full of energy and excitement, almost mimicking the movement of a subway train.  Through Allerton Mandalas, Brody set out to reflect upon the multi-faceted communities of the Bronx.

        "art_description": "Jim Hodges' mirrored-glass artwork \"I dreamed a world and called it Love\" is nestled above the busiest entrance at Grand Central-42 St. Reflections of riders are a constant but ever-changing element of this public installation. No two visits will ever be the same.\n\nThe expansive work is located near the 42 Street entrance on the landing and mezzanine levels of the stairs and escalator that connect Grand Central Terminal with the subway station. It's composed of over 5,000 pieces of glass in more than 70 different colors. The composition inverts the commuter\u00d5s visual experience of descending underground. The progression begins with an upper landing rendered in sparkling deep blues that reference the celestial ceiling of Grand Central Terminal\u00d5s Main Concourse and contrast the pale stone architecture of the terminal. It then bursts into a kaleidoscope of color on the lower mezzanine, dazzling against the backdrop of black granite in the renovated subway entrance.\n\nCamouflage serves as a representation of nature. The artwork's organic patterning contains a sense of life. Shapes appear fluid and imbue the surface with a swirling visual dynamism that mimics the pulsating energy of the station itself.",

The floral motif continues as one goes farther; next are columns adorned with abstractions of flower forms.  Decorative inserts in the railings hark back to the original fences of the facilities.  And finally, the station opens up visually to the outside; large window openings with floral motifs repeated from the fencing outline the tracks below. Patsy Norvell, the artist, says of Garden Stops:  \u00d2It is an environment that surrounds you rather than something you stop to look at.  As viewers pass through, the work\u00d5s elements evoke the history of the stations, trigger people\u00d5s own memories, and a spark a kind of inner dialogue about space, nature, and change.\u00d3",

The laminated glass artwork highlights the native flora in the area, and the deciduous woodlands, ponds, swamps, wetlands, meadows, and conifer forests that were once dominant features in the location. The palette choices for Outlook are inspired by the current colors visible in the neighborhood, including those found in the existing architecture, storefronts, restaurants and public spaces. Carr worked closely with Peters Studios to translate her original landscape paintings into hand-painted glass to be integrated into the station facades and windows in the waiting area.",

Mosaika Art & Design translated Berr\u2019o\u00d5s series of collaged paintings, built from patterned papers, into richly textured and colorful mosaics. The surreal and fantastical compositions are layered with vibrant patterns, figures playing instruments and folkloric animals including cheetahs, swans, parrots, and butterflies.\n\nThe artwork panels are evocative of the drama and majesty of journeys taken by individual travelers who may have immigrated from another country, state, or borough. The artist strives to inspire and remind passengers that they are in the realm of possibility, beauty, and magic. Berr\u2019o encourages viewers to explore their exterior and inner worlds of creativity, mystery, and joy.",

The line transports creative people pursuing their dreams and real-life heroes who provide essential services. In New York, these riders are often dressed in black, which Bradford believes is \"merely a cloak over an inner life that is wildly colorful and unconventional.\"  \n\n\u00d2I want to give back to these subway travelers their own sense of whimsy,\" Bradford says. \"I want to give them the possibility of stories that evoke enchantment over reality and a kind of technicolor backdrop to their subway experience.\u00d3  \n\nThe beings that populate the scenes are ethereal and intriguing, inspiring the viewer to reconsider the outward expression of one\u00d5s own interior vivacity.

        "art_description": "Artist James Garvey hand forged functional bronze sculptures and designed them to literally integrate into the station\u00d5s architecture. The nine sculptural Lariat Tapers wrap around the Tuscan columns at the historic Wall Street station. Since the station is located in the financial district, Garvey crafted these functional seats to convey the location of the wind-swept \u00d2corridors of finance\u00d3. The tapers swirl in a clockwise direction around the columns to depict the motion of trains swooping into the station. Comparing the Lariat Tapers to Garvey\u00d5s precedent artwork Lariat Seat Loops sited at the 33rd Street Station (6), the Lariat Tapers are realized as a more sensuous form, a deliberate attempt to interact with and catch the attention of commuters who work in the financial district. At the 33rd Street Station, the dynamic between the Seat Loop and the historic I-beam column imparts a uniquely fresh impression, while Garvey\u00d5s design for the Wall Street Station acknowledges, respects, and highlights the station\u00d5s history and architecture.",

Mosaika Art & Design translated Berr\u2019o\u00d5s series of collaged paintings, built from patterned papers, into richly textured and colorful mosaics. The surreal and fantastical compositions are layered with vibrant patterns, figures playing instruments and folkloric animals including cheetahs, swans, parrots, and butterflies.\n\nThe artwork panels are evocative of the drama and majesty of journeys taken by individual travelers who may have immigrated from another country, state, or borough. The artist strives to inspire and remind passengers that they are in the realm of possibility, beauty, and magic. Berr\u2019o encourages viewers to explore their exterior and inner worlds of creativity, mystery, and joy.",

The station artwork depicts seven flowering plants that are sourced from the Madison Square Park Conservancy\u00d5s Perennial Collection. The flowers include Red Buds, Magnolias, Hellebores, Witch Hazel, Daffodils, Hydrangea and Camellia. The blooming plants were chosen as representation of plant species that withstand changing climate conditions of the city.\n\nSimilar to an everchanging garden, ROAMING UNDERFOOT creates a delightful place to enjoy during every season. Blum\u00d5s intent was to capture some of the magic of the nearby park, regarded as an urban sanctuary, and to enhance the station environment for transit riders.

A total of three murals are located within the north mezzanine, one next to the newly installed elevators and the other two on the walls above the north stairs that lead to the northbound and southbound platforms. The mosaic murals were fabricated by Mosaicos Venecianos de M\u017dxico and encompass approximately 370 square feet of wall space.\n\nLizardo\u00d5s project encapsulates the immigrant experience\u00d1leaving home, enduring the arduous journey, and eventually arriving in an unfamiliar city. With Great Waves of Immigration, the artist seeks to acknowledge the Washington Heights community\u00d5s historical migration patterns, which has given rise to its large Dominican population. She was inspired by the neighborhood\u00d5s architecture and beauty, exemplified by the iconic George Washington Bridge, images of which are superimposed and layered within the murals.\n\nJuxtaposed with these representations of iconic landmarks are portraits of the many people who travelled across vast bodies of water to settle in the area, the most recent of which include the Dominican community. Across from the turnstiles, the largest mural is divided into two parts using a yellow and gold color scheme. In the foreground is a giant overfilled yola, a Dominican boat used to make the journey over to U.S. territory. Above the downtown stairwell is a portrait of a woman holding part of a certificate of citizenship, and in the uptown stairwell is an image of an unidentified woman whose last living address was in Washington Heights. Together, these artworks remind the viewer of the diverse and ever-changing populations that have long called New York City home.",

        "art_description": "Artist Rita MacDonald works with everyday patterns in much of her work, manipulating and enlarging the shapes to fit architectural spaces in her installations and painstakingly rendering each line in her prints. Often her patterns are based upon fabrics from old clothes or well-worn curtains. In her two-station project on the Brighton Line, she puts these practices to good use, creating a trompe l'oiel effect in which the tile wall is folded back like a curtain to reveal a vintage wallpaper-like pattern behind. The fabricator, Miotto Mosaics, faced a challenging technical puzzle of trimming rectangular tiles to resemble an unfurling form so that it seem as though an invisible hand has peeled back a layer of the wall.\n\nMacDonald wanted to create the effect of a remodeling in progress, honoring the station rehabilitation process, and created an updated craftsman-era pattern that references the historic homes in the Midwood community. In her words, \"The revealed pattern is a decidedly more pastoral pattern - inspired in color, form, and design both by the residential nature of the neighboring streets and by pattern design from the beginning of the twentieth century, the time at which the station was originally built. I'm interested in the intersection of these two patterns as a metaphor for the idea that architecture and space can be holders of our collective memory.\"\n\nAvenues J and M share this metaphoric motif. Avenue M features a rabbit design with rabbits leaping from the wall and hopping along the station stairs. Avenue J depicts birds who fan out from the pattered wall and seem to fly throughout the station. The creatures appear to have escaped from the old- fashioned wall pattern of the past to join us here in the present day station. The birds and rabbits add a sense of whimsy while at the same time engaging people who use their own forms of transportation. In an inspired flight of fancy, the animals travel to the neighboring stations: a bird is seen mixing it up with the rabbits at Avenue M and at Avenue J, a rabbit hops over to visit with the birds.",

No two visits will ever be the same.\n\nThe expansive work is located near the 42 Street entrance on the landing and mezzanine levels of the stairs and escalator that connect Grand Central Terminal with the subway station. It's composed of over 5,000 pieces of glass in more than 70 different colors. The composition inverts the commuter\u00d5s visual experience of descending underground. The progression begins with an upper landing rendered in sparkling deep blues that reference the celestial ceiling of Grand Central Terminal\u00d5s Main Concourse and contrast the pale stone architecture of the terminal. It then bursts into a kaleidoscope of color on the lower mezzanine, dazzling against the backdrop of black granite in the renovated subway entrance.\n\nCamouflage serves as a representation of nature. The artwork's organic patterning contains a sense of life. Shapes appear fluid and imbue the surface with a swirling visual dynamism that mimics the pulsating energy of the station itself.",

        "art_description": "Mary Miss is fascinated by the material remains of the recent past and takes delight in highlighting the interest of others with her observations about them.  The oldest parts of the MTA transportation system have been in existence for only a little over a century, but for Miss they provide an archaeological treasure trove.  Working with architect Lee Harris Pomeroy, she has used the old Union Square station\u00d5 s transformation into a modern and efficient transit hub, as an opportunity to explore, observe, learn, and teach.  For Miss, new construction at the site uncovered hidden wonders \u00d0 structural elements, cables, and conduits \u00d0 some of them still functional and others superseded by more modern improvements.  Also, old decorative work reappeared \u00d0 mosaics, pilasters, and name plaques \u00d0  including six eagles in terra cotta dating from the 1904 station that had been presumed destroyed.  \n\nMiss set out to share her findings with users of the station, drawing their attention to the previously hidden wonders though a network of frames, windows, apertures, and mirrors to focus viewers and then to ask them to ponder the changes that this environment has experienced over time.  The bright red frames are immediate attention-grabbers; what is framed by them may be more subtle \u00d0 a bolt, a fragment of ancient-looking mosaic, a piece of rusted steel cable.   Other frames call attention to the station\u00d5s historic name plaques.   Another framing device is a series of red slots intersected into the enameled black railings that surround above-track walkways, suggesting to travelers that a pause to look though them and downward to the tracks will provide a rewarding lesson in station design and technology.  In her words, \u00d2I\u00d5m inviting the public to look below the surface, to see a \u00d4slice\u00d5 of the station, its structure, its history.  In this most public of places, the apertures offer and intimate engagement.  Looking in, you will see the station\u00d5s workings \u00d0 sometimes you will see layers of words and reflected images, including your own!\u00d3\n\nMiss is perhaps best known for her works that blend landscape and constructed forms.  A prime example is her sinuous sculptural forms on the waterfront at South Cove in Manhattan\u00d5s Battery Park City; another is her proposal for the viewing area at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles.  As at Union Square, Miss\u00d5s sometimes enigmatic introductions into the environment tempt travelers to pay attention to things they may not have otherwise noticed.",

        "art_description": "Nancy Holt's steel ceiling sculpture incorporating lighting at the Fulton Street and Broadway/Nassau subway station, is an example of Arts for Transit's early efforts to have the artist work closely with the architect of the station, Lee Harris Pomeroy, to integrate the artwork with the architecture.    \n\nAn environmental artist, Holt creates art by giving physical form to universal cycles of the sun, moon, and stars.  Previous work concentrating on the heavens has included her Sun Tunnels (Great Basin Desert, Utah, 1973-76), a site-specific work with four tunnels aligned to the rising and setting of the sun on the summer and winter solstices.  In the upper half of each tunnel are holes in the configuration of a constellation, the holes differing in diameter according to the magnitude of the stars they represent.  The sun, also a star, shines through the holes casting ellipses and circles of light on the bottom of the tunnels during the day.  Holt\u00d5s Dark Star Park (Rosslyn,  Arlington, Virginia, 1979-1984) is an urban renewal project consisting of pipes, tunnels, circular pools and spheres that the artist thinks of as fallen stars.\n\nIn Astral Grating, Holt has surrounded lights with graduated circular rings making domed openings in a dropped steel grate ceiling.  \"The rings and light fixtures in this ceiling light sculpture are in the configuration of the stars in five constellations: Aries, Auriga, Canis Major, Cygnus and Piscus Austrinus,\" says Holt.  The number of lights in a cluster and the diameter of the domed openings vary in size according to the brightness of the stars represented.   The heavens have thus been brought underground.\n\nAs part of the new Fulton Street Transit Center, plans are for Astral Grating to be reinstalled into the reconfigured passageways.",

        "art_description": "Bushwick residents come to life in George Bates\u00d5 Generation Dynamica at the Central Avenue station. Consisting of 20 stainless steel panels in the station\u00d5s platform windscreens, the work depicts larger characters encompassing smaller figures in silhouette, referencing the many populations who make the community their home. The scale of figures within figures causes the viewer\u00d5s the eye to keep moving across the panels, but what becomes quickly apparent is that all are connected.\n\nGeneration Dynamica seeks to show how communities are in flux and are shaped by the contributions and aspirations of its individual members and their personal histories. Bates includes elements from the area\u00d5s social history and waves of immigration, from Germany and Central America, and many places in between. The diversity of musical sounds is also represented in the artwork, and is further evidence of the rich cultural traditions\u00d0new and emerging\u00d0that the artist wanted to convey.\n\nThe artwork is fabricated in waterjet cut stainless steel by KC Fabrications. Bates spent many years as a resident of the community served by the station. His inventive use of line and form gives personality to the dozens of figures showcased in the artwork. The figures span age groups and demographics, and each are engaged in activity that represents characteristics about their lives. Together they represent a richly dynamic neighborhood which the artwork panels represent in keenly observed detail.",

        "art_description": "Vito Acconci\u00d5s Wall-Slide asks subway riders to think of the 161st Street station as an archaeological site.  His tongue-in-cheek dislocations of its walls allow the curious to \u00d2see\u00d3 the stone and steel underneath.  Elsewhere, protruding and receding walls magically provide seating for people waiting for the train.  Parts of the project thrust through floors and ceilings and at one point even project aboveground.  The overall effect is as if the station has been pushed and pulled in various directions to accentuate the relationship of the building to the earth into which it has been inserted.\nThis important and complex project was one of the first truly collaborative ones to be undertaken by Arts for Transit.  The architects, diDomenico + Partners, had been given the task of redesigning the station, including the challenge of opening up the lower levels to allow light to flow through to them.  Early on, it was realized that this was the perfect opportunity for an artist to work closely with the architects.\n\nInternationally known Vito Acconci \u00d0 who had grown up in the Bronx \u00d0 was a logical choice.  Acconci has had a very active and diverse career.  He began his career as a poet and in the late 1960s and early 1970s was a well known performance artist.   In recent projects he has joined with architects and landscape designers to visualize and build ambitious constructions that meditate on and meld the meeting of private and public spaces.  At the Yankee Stadium station, his illusion of walls being opened to the outside led to the opportunity to include yet another work of art, one that would be revealed as the walls in the elevated station slid up on the ceiling and down through the floors.",

Feet follow you everywhere throughout the Court Square (23rd Street and Ely Avenue) subway station, whether you are walking or riding the people mover.  Elizabeth Murray has called her artwork Stream, to evoke feet as they stream out along the passageway.  Initially the artist had planned to create a totally abstract work, but eventually decided to continue with imagery in the manner she used to great acclaim with her previous project, Blooming, in the Lexington Avenue and 59th  Street  station.  \nThis is not the first time Elizabeth Murray has moved from total abstraction to the introduction of imagery.  To be sure, her early work included simple colorful abstract forms and lines, but early on she introduced familiar shapes and forms as well.  Murray kept her audience in mind as she created these magical forms; they connect spaces as people travel through them.  They also connect viewers with the spirit of the artist as mosaic tesserae in vibrant colors fill the walls.  Murray has said that she embraces the changes that occur during her process of creation, that in fact change is integral to her working method. The changes that occur are part of the art.  What could be more fitting in a space that is constantly changing throughout the day with the sea of people passing by?\nThe public art of Elizabeth Murray is in many ways definitive of the MTA collection.  It sends the message to the public that the art is for them.  This is the philosophy of Arts for Transit brought to life.   Here is work that is the very best of what art in the public realm can be.  It is the work of an internationally recognized artist on a par with the artist\u00d5s work exhibited in museums.  It speaks clearly and resoundingly \u00d0 not up or down, just to.",

        "art_description": "Today Broadway and Lafayette is an intersection of art and commerce, ringed with historic facades and glossy billboards.   In Signal, artist Mel Chin, collaborating with Seneca tribe member Peter Jemison, draws upon the rich history of this crossroads, which served as a trading route for the tribes of the Six Nations (Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Mohawk, Tuscarora, and Oneida).    \n\nThe mezzanine walls contain figures that represent the nations with out-stretched arms reaching to one another.   The main concourse has conical forms at the base of support pillars.  They break up the severe geometry of the space and evoke the form of campfires, used to send signals. \n\n In this version, there are lights set within the campfire forms that brighten as trains approach and dim as trains depart.  Patterns within the steel forms are based upon tribal badge patterns, which themselves were based upon a fusion of various cultures with which the tribes communicated.  Another historical overlay is seen in the tile patterns that surround the concourse; they evoke rising smoke while the pattern is inspired by an Iroquois message of peace. The blue and white tile also brings to mind the presence of  the Dutch in the area, known for their blue and white tile work.\n\nMel Chin is known for making art in unexpected places, including landfills and decaying buildings.  Born in Texas to Chinese parents, he spent his formative years in a primarily Latino and African American neighborhood.  He insists that art should \u00d2provoke greater social awareness and responsibility\u00d3 and has been especially active in the movement to introduce art into inner-city communities.",

The artwork depicts figural sculptures with seating elements and whimsical surface design on windscreen panels. Figures from local history as well as present-day residents were the inspiration for the stainless steel sculptures.

        "art_description": "Arts for Transit has strived to bring a successful collaboration between \u00d2architect/artist \u00d3 to fruition \u00d0 the artist and architect working within a shared vision.  The bewildering junction of subway lines of the Atlantic Avenue Terminal Complex presented a perfect opportunity to further explore this idea.  Trakas has created critically acclaimed public art works around the world, including a bridge at a knife factory in Thiers, France, called the Sword Bridge, which, although minimal, unmistakably evokes the idea of a blade; it is consummate Trakas: simple, thoughtful and even profound in attention to form and materials. \n\nAt Atlantic Avenue, the architects\u00d5 intent was to bring together a myriad of passages and stairways to create a functional space with a unified feeling. Trakas\u00d5s ideas are melded with the equally clear vision of architects di Domenico + Partners to  create forms and spaces that underscore both the efficiency and beauty of the cavernous space, once again evoking the philosophy under which the original subway was built.\n\nTrakas carefully selected the stone pavers and bollards incorporated into the plaza at the station.  The architects designed a skylight for the roof of the historic station kiosk to help illuminate the platform below.  The former entry building now includes a brick-sized opening equipped with a lens which adds interest, allowing riders a downward view into the subway.  A boat-shaped gantry, made of stainless steel and mesh, is situated beneath the skylight; this is both aesthetically pleasing and a functional amenity (it allows workers to access the area for cleaning and changing light bulbs).  \n\nOne particularly clever element is a granite \u00d2wave\u00d3 sited at the point where the two stations, Atlantic and Pacific, cross \u00d0 and it succeeds in making these passageways flow.   Playing on the names Atlantic and Pacific, the overall idea is to suggest a place of landing and departure \u00d0 functions that both subway stations and seaports share.  To complete the metaphor, the central kiosk is constructed in the form of a lighthouse, which helps guide travelers through the maze-like complex.",

Future is reflected by new developments and the environment, reflected through different levels of transparency in the glass. The various layers present both a timeline and an organic portrayal of the community.\n\nIn creating the artwork, Mauricio was inspired by the powerful natural setting of the Rockaways that has provided life for centuries and attracted many to move to the area in the last 150 years. As people from Rockaway may say, \u00d2Once you get sand in your shoes, you\u00d5ll come back.\u00d3 Lopez\u00d5s artwork honors those who have lived and live in the Rockaway and their tenacity and commitment to their community.",

She became especially well acquainted with the \u00d2El\u00d3 in the Bronx while riding it daily for many years.  From this vantage point she witnessed extraordinary, even \u00d2magical,\u00d3 things, she says.   Explaining the source of her inspiration for the work, Bursztyn says that the birds and trees told her stories.  She viewed tiny gardens of lushness and dreamed of the exotic animals living in the zoo nearby.  In the evening, sunsets filled the sky with a kaleidoscope of color.  The train rides almost felt like riding through the clouds.  Then the artist strove to bring new meaning to familiar locations by sharing her visions with subway riders.  Dina Bursztyn has been creating public art for more than 20 years and through it, she says, she seeks to create contemporary mythology and present fresh possibilities, both literally and metaphorically.",

His Good Morning and Good Night mirror the pedestrian flow of riders commuting in and out of their home neighborhoods day after day.  Good Morning is on the inbound side of the station, which fills in the morning hours; Good Night welcomes travelers home as the evening arrives.  Born in Cuba, Consuegra was a member of an influential abstract expressionist group, The Eleven, in the 1950s.  They banded together producing the largest portion of their work during 1953 through 1955, and disbanded immediately after.  In 1967, after participating in various exhibitions in Europe, he sought political asylum in Spain and eventually moved to New York City, in 1970.",

Woven into the background are images of the people who form the Bronx community. They live and work in the area and are the people we see and travel with each day.

        "art_description": "Walter Martin and Paloma Mu\u2013oz have turned the Canal Street Station into something at first glance reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock\u00d5s The Birds.  But the birds in The Gathering are not menacing but somehow comforting.  There are dozens of them in total \u00d0 174 grackles and blackbirds, in a number of different poses, and seven crows, all cast in bronze and given a glossy black patinated coating.  They stand in groups, like people waiting in the subway, thinking, conversing, or studiedly ignoring one another.  Most of them can be found roosting on railings, watching and serving as companions to the flocks of people using the transportation system.  Birds, the artists note, are very social creatures \u00d0 just like New Yorkers; riders may find echoes of themselves and other subway travelers in their lively, cocky, quizzical interactions.\n\nCanal Street has been a commercial area for many decades.  Once primarily a warehouse district, today it is a main artery of several busy neighborhoods, long-established Little Italy and Chinatown and the newer and more hip SoHo and TriBeCa.  The street\u00d5s offerings range from Chinese delicacies, produce and herbal medicines to electronics to restaurants serving every kind of dish in every price range.  \n\nBut one thing that Canal Street largely lacks is the leavening influence of nature.  The birds of A Gathering make up for this, enlivening the space and bringing relief from the sometimes oppressive commercialism of the area.  Walter Martin and Paloma Mu\u2013oz, whose studio is in Brooklyn, have collaborated on art for many years. As part of Arts for Transit\u00d5s Lightbox Project, they installed their series of \u00d2Travelers,\u00d3 in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.  They created of 20 sculptural vignettes and photographed them to appear to be snow globes, creating magical winter wonderlands.  Part of this series traveled to the Wilshire/Normandie Metro Rail station in Los Angeles as part of Metro Arts Lightbox Series.",

        "art_description": "Brooklyn, New Morning at the Broadway Junction subway station in Brooklyn consists of 75 faceted glass panels, no two alike, which are arranged into a series of murals throughout the complex as well as a seven-by-ten-foot glass mosaic mural wall.   Al Loving, who created the work, talks about the medium: \n\nFaceted glass is an opportunity to work with real light \u00c9 In ancient Chinese culture the spiral was the tip of the flame.  In contemporary time it is a symbol of continuity.  I have tried to bring a spirit of inclusiveness to this project. \n\nLoving has said of the work that it expresses a \u00d2spirit of interdependence and interconnection as an important aspect of the American experience,\u00d3 reflecting the fact that this large station is literally a cultural crossroad.  Working with natural light, the artist aims to \u00d2fuse human animism with intellectual visual consciousness.\u00d3  The overall effect of the work is to bring a new liveliness into the station; its vividly colorful and energetic forms introduce a sense of optimism and well-being.  \n\nAl Loving, a well-known African American collage artist, painter, and educator, enjoyed a long and productive career.  In 1969, his hard-edged geometric paintings in a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of Art brought him to the attention of the museum-going public.  He was fascinated with the shape of a spiral and spent much of his life exploring this form as well as inquisitively studying the properties of bright and bold colors.  Loving\u00d5s work has been described as fluid.  In 1974, in a New York Times review, he described his multi-layered, acrylic painted constructions as \u00d2dynamically composed reliefs, wall pieces that energize the space around them, seemingly almost to be caught in the act of moving across the wall.\u00d3  This dynamic quality infuses Brooklyn, New Morning as well, but this time in glass and glass mosaic.",

The 14 artwork panels, fabricated by Mosaika Art & Design, echo a sensory feeling of motion and sequential transition. Rendered in a bright palette and filled with contrasts of color and form, the pieces create vignettes that weave together references of backyard windows, sidewalk market displays, and juxtapose nature with the urban environment.

Miotto Mosaic Art Studios fabricated the artwork in glass mosaic and installed it in conjunction with ADA accessibility upgrades for the station.\n\nAlong the North Mezzanine Passageway, drawings of iridescent turtles populate the curved wall while recontextualized depictions of neighborhood maps, buildings, and plants emerge from their shells. These turtles hold significance in creation stories shared by Indigenous peoples such as the Lenape and those of the Northeastern Woodlands, as well as in Hindu and Chinese mythologies, where the earth is believed to be carried on the back of a giant turtle. Derived from interpretations found in scientific journals and Indigenous cultures, Ferreira\u00d5s turtles bridge the natural world with the mystical.\n\nFerreira continues the use of iridescent glass in the advertising niches as cropped views of the turtles and their shell architecture appear within the rectangular frames. Reminiscent of swirling algae in lakes, the iridescent glass background also evokes a sense of the otherworldly and cosmic as mosaic tesserae glisten as customers move through the station. Ferreira\u00d5s artwork encourages viewers to reflect on the changing histories and landscapes of the neighborhood while providing a fantastical narrative to show connections across cultural traditions.",

        "art_description": "At the Avenue U station, on the Sea Beach line, Brooklyn-based artist Sally Gil created a series of fourteen mosaics entitled Edges of a South Brooklyn Sky. Reflecting on the Gravesend neighborhood where the Avenue U station is located, Gil used her poetic style to re-interpret and re-situate recognizable places and objects found throughout the area. Each of the fourteen mosaic panels whimsically represents Gravesend, and the diverse communities living there past and present. \n\nThere are seven mosaics on each of the station\u00d5s platforms, each containing a roving skyline and depicting familiar structures and things, such as Italian rainbow cookies, a quail egg, a Mexican Concha cookie, railroad tracks, and even the station house at the Avenue U subway entrance. Local architectural structures are placed close to the center line of all fourteen mosaics, because, as Gil says, \u00d2the horizon line is where the business of living happens.\u00d3 Concurrently the myriad objects, representing the rich social texture of the multiethnic Gravesend community, float amidst the day and night skies. This is where, as Gil says, \u00d2the internal life lives, all the complex and mystifying contemplations that move us.\u00d3 The day and night skies are reversed in form and concept across the platforms, helping to situate daily commuters in time and space, as they leave from and arrive back to the Avenue U station. \n\nSally Gil uses painting and mixed media collage to make her artworks. For the Avenue U station, her fourteen, original mixed media pieces were fabricated in glass mosaic by Mosaicos Venezianos de M\u017dxico. Gil worked closely the mosaicists to replicate her small scale works into the fourteen large scale mosaic murals now permanently located along the platforms. As riders move through the Edges of a South Brooklyn Sky, artist Sally Gil reminds us that, \u00d2every day we are making our place in the world, and the subway is the conduit that transports us. We live on a physical plane, while dwelling in our thoughts and imaginations -- the world of our own stories. Ultimately I believe, although from differing places, we all want the same things: To live peacefully, with what we need and want\".",

        "art_description": "Dom (Variations) appears as an apparition at the Fresh Pond Station \u00d0 a warm and inviting bedroom welcoming commuters to their home station. A neat bed, wallpapered wall, firm pillows and shiny furniture complete the scene. The artist\u00d5s intent is to reflect the path that flows from within the interior space of a cozy home to the exterior world, tracing the daily commute to work and the return home. Based on the concept of \u00d2home\u00d3, the mosaic mural, located across from the mezzanine entrance, depicts a lived in domestic interior scene, complete with scattered garments, books and a floor lamp. The pattern of the wallpaper on the bedroom\u00d5s back wall derives from a map, while natural elements like tree-leaves and branches invade the room \u00d0 and seem to themselves form into wallpaper. The image of a window within the mosaic emulates the real windows in the next two stations. It is an innovative use of materials, in the techniques used to print on tile and the combination of subway tile and mosaic to represent depth and texture.\n\nAt the Seneca Avenue and Forest Avenue stations, the imagery printed and hand-painted on glass, is of clothes hanging on clotheslines. Lovingly rendered, the clothing speaks to residents and domesticity, bringing a human scale to an otherwise everyday subway passage. Natural elements and branches and trees can be seen through the semi-translucent glass, echoing the imagery found within the Fresh Pond station mosaic mural. Overall, the work seeks to inspire an ethereal and dreamy atmosphere that evokes memories of the past and of a dreamed home.",

        "art_description": "The new monumental work at the South Ferry Terminal by Mike and Doug Starn investigates the nature of objects and transformation using light and documentary sources. A fused glass wall reveals images of tree limbs and leaves in silhouette adapted from photographic imagery. These formations relate to the place above, Battery Park, the historic fortress and Manhattan's southern boundary. The glass brings light and poetry to the station, the City's first new subway station in decades. \n\nCompanion pieces show a decayed over-scaled leaf that refers to the passage of time and links the park to its historical role. A map, that shows contemporary Manhattan and old New York as an overlay, is a beautiful mosaic and eloquent expression of the city's evolution, conveying to the throngs who use the station, a sense of its significant location. The artists designed a laser-cut stainless steel fence to separate the entry from the paid section of the station; its leaf motif connects the art in the station with the surrounding environment. \n\nThe Starns' work combines various forms, such as sculpture, painting, video, and installation. Their work has been exhibited in museums and galleries worldwide for more than two decades. In South Ferry, their explorations of light and dark, nature and technology, come together in an evocative artwork. Its title refers, among other associations, to the South Ferry subway line, which becomes a network of splitting lines that travels through the changing landscape as seen in the map. As the artwork reveals, the City and its lifelines evolve in an organic form, as dropping leaves lead to new growth, the City keeps growing - and changing.",

The imagery is manipulated and re-configured with each station level having its own focus, palette and material. As one enters and descends the 3rd Avenue escalator, the view is filled with ceramic tile depicting construction beams and the cranes that dismantled the El in the 1940s. At the mezzanine, a mosaic reveals the sky where the train had previously been present, and people from the era of this neighborhood transformation. The platform level features semi-transparent and reflective glass depicting vintage scenes of the neighborhood, enabling contemporary viewers to see themselves in the cityscape of the past.\n\nJean Shin is a New York-based artist who creates elaborate sculptures and site-specific installations using accumulated cast-off materials. Her work has been widely exhibited in museums and cultural institutions nationally and abroad. Shin has been commissioned by the US General Services Administration and New York City\u00d5s Percent for Art program among others. Born in Seoul, South Korea and raised in the United States, Shin attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine and Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.",

She says of her work, \u00d2My living and my art are intertwined.  My vision is informed by family and friends, ongoing conversations, and experiences of the spirit.  This totality juxtaposes in a m\u017dlange of sights and sounds, a music that is always trying to impart a visual message that will engage the senses and hold the eyes\u00d5 intelligence, which revealing much about what is seen at any given time.\u00d3\n\nThe images of Maynard\u00d5s translucent glass mosaic are designed to \u00d2capture the boundless energy, the beacon of light that was and is our own homegrown Mecca: the Harlem of our dreams, our imaginings and our reality.  The stairwells are dedicated to the artists and visionaries whose flights of creativity, as they seek sustenance for body and soul, culminate in transcendent forms that nourish the community\u00d5s consciousness and spirit.\u00d3 \n\nValerie Maynard is nationally known for her multimedia work and public art focusing on social issues.  Her work dealing with people of color has appeared abroad as well, including her representation of the United States at the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture in Nigeria in 1977.  Maynard's \"No Apartheid Anywhere\" is a particularly notable ongoing media project, which explores forms of enslavement. She was born in New York, studied printmaking at the New School, received a master\u00d5s degree in sculpture at Goddard College, and now lives in Baltimore.",

        "art_description": "In creating the artwork for the Dyckman Street station, Wopo Holup found inspiration in nature. Birds in Flight-Moon View consists of ceramic tile reliefs of birds in flight that were originally installed in 1991 (and titled Birds in Flight) within the white tile of the mezzanine wall and stairwells. With the opportunity presented when the station was recently rehabilitated, the artist was commissioned by MTA Arts for Transit and created white ceramic, low relief tile of the moon and earth surrounded by a white mosaic banding. The new work provides an extraordinary modern view of the earth as seen from the moonscape (from the Apollo missions). Blending with the existing station tiles, the circular shapes of the composition compliment the arched windows of the historic station and expand the view from the earlier artwork, by continuing the sky view-further up and out.\n\nIn the artist\u00d5s words, \u00d2Birds in Flight-Moon View greets customers upon entering the station and emphasizes nature and the vastness of the universe.\u00d2 Nature and biological forms of the urban landscape are brought within the interior environment of the station for the public to enjoy.",

The laminated glass artwork highlights the native flora in the area, and the deciduous woodlands, ponds, swamps, wetlands, meadows, and conifer forests that were once dominant features in the location. The palette choices for Outlook are inspired by the current colors visible in the neighborhood, including those found in the existing architecture, storefronts, restaurants and public spaces.

But to put them into the proper context, the now-famous are shown among the ordinary people of Harlem going about their daily affairs \u00d0 at play, studying, going to church.  \u00d2It\u00d5s about being connected,\u00d3 Birch says.  \u00d2Harlem is a village built on global energy, infused with the histories of migrants from Africa, the American South, and the Caribbean.\u00d3\n\nBirch calls New Orleans his home, but he also maintains a studio in New York.  The theme of returning to roots often permeates his artwork.  As stated by fellow artist Robert Taplin writing in Art in America, among contemporary black artists \u00d2Birch is one of the most forthright in adopting an \u00d4Africanizing\u00d5 cultural model. \u00c9  In the end, it\u00d5s [his] clear sense of design that makes it all work.\u00d3\n\nIn Harlem Timeline, on the downtown platform, along with a depiction of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Birch shows Langston Hughes reading from his works and Reverend Adam Clayton Powell Jr. preaching to a rapt gathering.  Boxing champion Joe Louis is depicted triumphing over an opponent and Charlie Parker excels on the saxophone.  \n\nHeaded uptown, riders are treated to a moving rendition of the blues, with Billie Holiday singing her heart out.  Also shown are jazz greats Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane, playing away, and Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey in their search for justice and equality.  Community services are represented by Harlem Hospital and its predecessor. \n\nBirch received his Masters of Fine Art from the Maryland Institute College of Art. He is a recipient of fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts.  A recent exhibition in New York City featured mixed-media work that revealed neighbors and friends in New Orleans, a world now forever altered.",

Light is a major theme of the piece, especially the burst of light that envelops a subway train when it leaves an underground tunnel and becomes elevated. African and Native American influences are integral to the work, as are arch shapes suggested by tunnels and \u00d4els.\u00d5  Charged with energy, color and music, reflecting myth and dance, these fulfill my wish to continue the tradition of mosaics in NYC's subway system.\"",

        "art_description": "While standing on the station platform, looking up from the street or gazing from a moving subway car, travelers and commuters can see twenty-four sparkling and detailed, water-jet cut, etched stainless steel artwork panels. Inspired by the buildings and homes of the Ozone Park/South Richmond Hill neighborhoods, Linda Ganjian created the detailed designs of Home Sweet Home, taking the visual vocabulary of lace and applying it to the architecture found in the area. From the rows of identical-seeming houses, the artist studied the forms, patterns, and textures that make each house unique. She captures with embroidery-like precision the diagonally-oriented aluminum siding, baroque ironwork on fences, zig-zag tiles, elephant garden statues and more. These often-seen, but overlooked decorative details are not entirely unique to this neighborhood but form the notion of home in our subconscious, defining the way we experience the city and place. Home Sweet Home honors the builders and craftsmen behind the urban architecture as much as the residents who enliven and take pride in it.",

Captivated by the great estates and summer homes dating to the area's rural origins, the artist re-imagined the neighborhood in her mosaic artwork, building detailed 3-D replicas that served as still-life models for her painstakingly detailed paintings, from which the mosaics were interpreted. Trees, grass and a light blue sky surround the houses and neighbors may be interpreted as from the past or the present.\n\nA portion of the artwork was reconfigured in 2021 due to the ADA upgrade at the station.",

Along the corridor, mosaic and glass artworks are on opposite walls. In the windows, glass panels reflect the arches of the historic station, flowers, and vines, creating an illusion of depth and light. On the walls, mosaic frames of silver mirror reflect the thematic arches and complete an effect of calmness sought by the artist, who follows feng-shui principles.\n\nThese works are balanced with five additional mosaics within the station. Two are located next to the stairs and portray small creatures and vases reminiscent of the niche bouquets at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Along the East 180th Street corridor that serves as a station exit, there are three more mosaics created with a blend of stones that echo the massive rock outcroppings found throughout the Bronx. A colorful peacock and lizard sit on the rocks, looking like they are taking a break from the nearby zoo.",

        "art_description": "Lisa Dinhofer\u00d5s Losing My Marbles is part of her ongoing fascination with marbles and other children\u00d5s toys.  \u00d2Toys are caricatures in miniature of society at large. \u00c9  they carry a collective, popular memory,\u00d3 she declared in her artist statement for the work.   The artwork is gigantic, taking up a large wall encountered by the subway rider head-on and two flanking walls, a total of 44 linear feet of wall space.  The main wall is designed as to simulate three-dimensional space, to draw the viewer into the work; the side walls help the artist to achieve a wrap-around effect.  \n\nDinhofer commented on her working method and the effects she achieves, \u00d2The goal of my work is to fascinate visually.  Through color, light, orchestrated movement and playful objects the audience is drawn into an enchanted environment where people become smaller and playing marbles loom large.  I am an \u00d4illusionist\u00d5 painter rather than a \u00d4realist.\u00d5  All the objects I depict are real, they exist, but I chose to create my own special plane . . . The marbles themselves inhabit our imagination and memory.  They are joyful and they are beautiful.  There are smiles in this piece, there is an exuberance to this piece, and ultimately there is a true delight.  And that is magic.\u00d3 \n\nTo stress the illusionist character of the piece, a golden trompe l\u00d5oeil frame surrounds the main wall, depicting a floor of black and white squares with marbles seemingly floating in space.  Concave murals are strategically introduced to add further dimension and to literally draw viewers deeper into the work, via their distorted reflections.  The marbles on the side walls seem to have burst forth from the main wall or else to be rushing to join them.  In her artist statement, Dinhofer commented, \u00d2Here I can be an abstract expressionist and a realist at the same time.  My space is imaginary but my objects are observed.\u00d3",

The opportunity to create art throughout the terminal headhouse provided the artist with a large canvas to realize his vision, and the strong light that surrounds the terminal made glass the medium of choice.\n\nArtist Jason Rohlf created original paintings for the project, which were translated into hand-painted laminated glass panels, and treated to achieve the artist\u00d5s preference for a textured, multi-layered appearance. The artwork is visible to all who enter or leave the station \u00d0 and on both sides of the elevated platform where it meets the stairs and elevator. The art encompasses the NYC transit station, beaming light and color throughout the architectural space.\n\nRespite is an abstract landscape of birds perched on outstretched branches. The colors in the birds blend into the branches, symbolizing the connection between people and their community The series of luminous glass panels features three distinct color themes (green for dawn, blue for midday and orange for dusk) and relate to the strong links between nature and light in this seaside community.\n\n\u00d2As an artist, this project was a fantastic opportunity to really impact the architecture and create work that serves to connect the viewers with the surrounding landscape\u00d3, said Jason Rohlf. The colors in the glass reflect into shadows that splash throughout the station, providing a welcome and vibrant addition to the rider\u00d5s experience.",

Each of the 28 panels was hand carved by Lane with intricate detail that merged two specific architectural ornaments found on surrounding buildings to create a new pattern, one that evokes both the past and the present.\n\nAccording to Lane, \u00d2The imagery on the Knickerbocker panels comes from both a history of the local architecture and a history of my own work practice. I have been working with the shovel image for a while. I appreciate the shovel as a humble, practical object that has an elegant form like a gothic arch. Inverting the spade shape and repeating it made a gothic window tracery creating a kind of sacred space. The shape to me subtly connects class, religion, labor and luxury. The pattern in the shovel shape was taken from the local architecture, patterns that were repeated in the nearby brownstones of Bushwick, Brookllyn.\u00d3\n\nCal Lane, a trained welder prior to becoming an artist, transforms industrial objects into improbably delicate contemporary works of sculpture. Using a plasma cutter or an oxy-acetylene torch, she carves intricate decorative patterns into such industrial cast-offs as I-beams, oil drums, wheelbarrows, shovels, and dumpsters. Her work juxtaposes the domestic with the industrial, marrying functional objects often associated with blue-collar and masculine environments with patterns commonly used in textiles, such as lace, veils or tapestry. These utilitarian objects are thus incised with light and air, and transformed from their conventional past to become beautiful objects.",

Inspired by the buildings and homes of the Ozone Park/South Richmond Hill neighborhoods, Linda Ganjian created the detailed designs of Home Sweet Home, taking the visual vocabulary of lace and applying it to the architecture found in the area. From the rows of identical-seeming houses, the artist studied the forms, patterns, and textures that make each house unique. She captures with embroidery-like precision the diagonally-oriented aluminum siding, baroque ironwork on fences, zig-zag tiles, elephant garden statues and more. These often-seen, but overlooked decorative details are not entirely unique to this neighborhood but form the notion of home in our subconscious, defining the way we experience the city and place. Home Sweet Home honors the builders and craftsmen behind the urban architecture as much as the residents who enliven and take pride in it.",

        "art_description": "Artist Rita MacDonald works with everyday patterns in much of her work, manipulating and enlarging the shapes to fit architectural spaces in her installations and painstakingly rendering each line in her prints. Often her patterns are based upon fabrics from old clothes or well-worn curtains. In her two-station project on the Brighton Line, she puts these practices to good use, creating a trompe l'oiel effect in which the tile wall is folded back like a curtain to reveal a vintage wallpaper-like pattern behind. The fabricator, Miotto Mosaics, faced a challenging technical puzzle of trimming rectangular tiles to resemble an unfurling form so that it seem as though an invisible hand has peeled back a layer of the wall.\n\nMacDonald wanted to create the effect of a remodeling in progress, honoring the station rehabilitation process, and created an updated craftsman-era pattern that references the historic homes in the Midwood community. In her words, \"The revealed pattern is a decidedly more pastoral pattern - inspired in color, form, and design both by the residential nature of the neighboring streets and by pattern design from the beginning of the twentieth century, the time at which the station was originally built. I'm interested in the intersection of these two patterns as a metaphor for the idea that architecture and space can be holders of our collective memory.\"\n\nAvenues J and M share this metaphoric motif. Avenue M features a rabbit design with rabbits leaping from the wall and hopping along the station stairs. Avenue J depicts birds who fan out from the pattered wall and seem to fly throughout the station. The creatures appear to have escaped from the old- fashioned wall pattern of the past to join us here in the present day station. The birds and rabbits add a sense of whimsy while at the same time engaging people who use their own forms of transportation. In an inspired flight of fancy, the animals travel to the neighboring stations: a bird is seen mixing it up with the rabbits at Avenue M and at Avenue J, a rabbit hops over to visit with the birds.",

Joan linder created drawings of flora based upon wild vegetation seen from the streets and lots within a 6-block radius of the 71st Street station. The result is an elegant, dynamic and specific tribute to the landscape of Bensonhurst, which endures, among other things, as an echo of Brooklyn\u00d5s past. These panels act as windows to a lost history\u00d1a place shaped by Native Americans and farmers. The botanical images offer passengers an experience that is a counterpoint to the built environment of the city.\n\nEntitled The Flora of Bensonhusrt, the work is composed of six intricate drawings of plants flowing in the direction of train. Three on each platform, the plants rendered in cool colors (blue, green and purple) on the Manhattan bound platform alert the riders as they venture out in the morning. Whereas, those in warm colors (red, turquois, and orange) are placed on the Brooklyn bound platform to greet the commuters as they make their way home from work.\n\nFor the project, Linder painstakingly created large scale drawings in pen and ink on paper, which then be scaled and translated into laminated glass. The plants against a milky white background resemble a lightbox, which are constantly shifting under the daylight and also viewable at night from the street level.",

This is no longer the case. Felipe Galindo's Magic Realism in Kingsbridge stems from his study of the area's residents and his hopes that the imagery in his designs will engage the audience, inspiring them to meditate on their surroundings and see things they take for granted in a different way.\n\nGalindo says he sought to discover the unexpected treasures in the neighborhood-its life, diversity, nature, and most of all the power of imagination. Each element in the faceted glass panels presents a surprising scene. For example, a tropical island is found in the Harlem River, and a fire escape leads to the heavens, providing a sense of magic. Galindo feels that his artwork, with its combination of urban, natural, surreal and historical elements, provides an opportunity for viewers to experience something intriguing or surprising each time they pass through the 231 Street subway station.",

        "art_description": "Walter Martin and Paloma Mu\u2013oz have turned the Canal Street Station into something at first glance reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock\u00d5s The Birds.  But the birds in The Gathering are not menacing but somehow comforting.  There are dozens of them in total \u00d0 174 grackles and blackbirds, in a number of different poses, and seven crows, all cast in bronze and given a glossy black patinated coating.  They stand in groups, like people waiting in the subway, thinking, conversing, or studiedly ignoring one another.  Most of them can be found roosting on railings, watching and serving as companions to the flocks of people using the transportation system.  Birds, the artists note, are very social creatures \u00d0 just like New Yorkers; riders may find echoes of themselves and other subway travelers in their lively, cocky, quizzical interactions.\n\nCanal Street has been a commercial area for many decades.  Once primarily a warehouse district, today it is a main artery of several busy neighborhoods, long-established Little Italy and Chinatown and the newer and more hip SoHo and TriBeCa.  The street\u00d5s offerings range from Chinese delicacies, produce and herbal medicines to electronics to restaurants serving every kind of dish in every price range.  \n\nBut one thing that Canal Street largely lacks is the leavening influence of nature.  The birds of A Gathering make up for this, enlivening the space and bringing relief from the sometimes oppressive commercialism of the area.  Walter Martin and Paloma Mu\u2013oz, whose studio is in Brooklyn, have collaborated on art for many years. As part of Arts for Transit\u00d5s Lightbox Project, they installed their series of \u00d2Travelers,\u00d3 in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.  They created of 20 sculptural vignettes and photographed them to appear to be snow globes, creating magical winter wonderlands.  Part of this series traveled to the Wilshire/Normandie Metro Rail station in Los Angeles as part of Metro Arts Lightbox Series.",

        "art_description": "145th Street\nDEREK FORDJOUR\nPARADE, 2018\nGlass and ceramic mosaic\n\nGlass and ceramic mosaic artwork by Derek Fordjour appears throughout the historic 145th St-Lenox Av station, and celebrates the African-American parade tradition in Harlem and its pageantry. Miotto Mosaic Art Studios translated Fordjour\u00d5s layered surfaces into glass and ceramic mosaic, capturing the collage process inherent in his work. Based on his richly textured paintings created with humble materials such as newspaper, oil pastels, and charcoal, lines of drum majors, majorettes, dancers, and drummers joyfully parade along the platforms, and are accompanied by crowds of people and flags.\n\nFrom his historic research into the neighborhood, the artist touches on the legacy of parades through Harlem starting with the Harlem Hellfighters 369th Regiment in 1919 after WWI, through to the African American Day Parade founded during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s and continuing today. Fordjour\u00d5s artwork provides riders with a chance to encounter a celebration of community, history, and identity in the colorful art that complements the station\u00d5s improvements and reinforces the historic fabric of the station.\n\nDerek Fordjour is a Harlem-based artist of African-American heritage. In his richly textured paintings, the artist draws upon a variety of sources including sporting imagery, board games, and carnival motifs to explore ideas of vulnerability, aspiration, and structures of fairness. He has recently held residencies at the Sugar Hill Museum and the Sharpe-Walentas Studio Program, and was awarded the 2018 Deutsche Bank NYFA Fellowship Award. He is a graduate of Morehouse College, earned graduate degrees in Art Education from Harvard University, and painting from Hunter College.",

        "art_description": "In Ron Calloway\u00d5s Euphorbias, the artist used the imagery of plants as a metaphor for life and growth in the communities that surround the elevated Kosciuszko Street station. The work literally feels as if energy is moving from the center of the exquisitely beautiful images, radiating out to the tips of the forms.  The artwork consists of sixteen unique, faceted glass panels.  Brightly colored plants, some of which resemble the sun and its rays, bloom on the platform.  Ron Calloway\u00d5s artistic creativity started at a very young age when he designed costumes, organized and directed parades for neighborhood children.  As he matured, so did his skills and enthusiasm for the arts, and soon he was writing plays and drawing the images he saw within his mind\u00d5s eye.",

Each entrance features a different shade of blue and a blueprint-style vector line design, a visual theme that is integrated with the architecture, creating one of the most dynamic stations in the MTA system.\n\nSarah Sze represented the United States at the Venice Biennale in 2013, and was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2003. She has exhibited in museums worldwide, and her works are held in the permanent collections of prominent institutions, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

The artwork depicts figural sculptures with seating elements and whimsical surface design on windscreen panels. Figures from local history as well as present-day residents were the inspiration for the stainless steel sculptures. The artist refers to the early days of the area such as the arrival of European settlers and the foundation of the Culver train line at the turn of the 20th century bringing an expansion of residents in South Brooklyn. This series of joyful sculptures also captures themes of family life and resourcefulness in the neighborhood. For the windscreen panels, the artist utilized a single design to create multiple unique compositions arranged in different configurations. The positive and negative shapes of the design mirror each other from across the platform at each station. Gardair created all of the artwork with a no-waste design framework which relates to the future of the neighborhood and the environmental impact of all of New York City. Passengers will travel through time and imagination on their commute when experiencing Julien Gardair\u00d5s We are each others artwork at these two Culver Line Stations.",

        "art_description": "Eamon Ore-Giron worked with fabricator Mosaicos Venezianos de M\u017dxico to translate six original oil paintings into 24 glass mosaic panels that adorn the northbound and southbound platforms at the Bay Pkwy station in Brooklyn. Ore-Giron visualizes the world as abstract forms and shapes, and envisions the interaction and interplay of these shapes as a reflection of societal dynamics. This exchange between forms and his use of geometries symbolizes the ways in which people of different communities \u00d1 such as those surrounding the Bay Pkwy station \u00d1 negotiate their relationships with each other and new places, a process of reinvention and creation.  \n\nThe 12 mosaic panels on each platform reference the corresponding journey. As commuters travel southbound towards Coney Island, Ore-Giron\u00d5s designs reference the natural world, with fluid arcs and warm colors evoking the feelings one might have when going to the beach. The northbound platform mosaics mimic the movement of gears and the mechanics of the human-made world, conjuring feelings of New York\u00d5s ecstatic urban environment.  \n\n\"People\u00d5s Instinctive Travels: Homage to the Tribe\" originates from Ore-Giron\u00d5s \"certain nostalgia for global modernism,\" wherein \"public works meant to create a kind of civic mindedness and unity.\" His dynamic visual language references this unity, combined with the timelessness of indigenous and craft traditions. It is Ore-Giron\u00d5s hope that these mosaics will offer subway riders a space to see the world anew through the shapes, forms, colors, and movements of these artworks.",

The upright wall within the station also contains images/symbols of prowess on one side and Malcolm's words on the reverse side.  Here the idea of power, leadership and spiritual support are linked.  Malcolm X believed that we as African Americans have the power to determine out destinies.  This station is a reminder of that truth.\"",

According to the artists, the title of Carrying On can be read in a variety of ways.  \u00d2People on the streets of New York are almost always carrying something, sometimes something huge and outlandish.  After the 9/11 tragedy, New Yorkers felt that they must carry on with their lives.  Finally, New Yorkers are notoriously opinionated and lively; they really do \u00d4carry on.\u00d5\u00d3",

        "art_description": "Arts for Transit has strived to bring a successful collaboration between \u00d2architect/artist \u00d3 to fruition \u00d0 the artist and architect working within a shared vision.  The bewildering junction of subway lines of the Atlantic Avenue Terminal Complex presented a perfect opportunity to further explore this idea.  Trakas has created critically acclaimed public art works around the world, including a bridge at a knife factory in Thiers, France, called the Sword Bridge, which, although minimal, unmistakably evokes the idea of a blade; it is consummate Trakas: simple, thoughtful and even profound in attention to form and materials. \n\nAt Atlantic Avenue, the architects\u00d5 intent was to bring together a myriad of passages and stairways to create a functional space with a unified feeling. Trakas\u00d5s ideas are melded with the equally clear vision of architects di Domenico + Partners to  create forms and spaces that underscore both the efficiency and beauty of the cavernous space, once again evoking the philosophy under which the original subway was built.\n\nTrakas carefully selected the stone pavers and bollards incorporated into the plaza at the station.  The architects designed a skylight for the roof of the historic station kiosk to help illuminate the platform below.  The former entry building now includes a brick-sized opening equipped with a lens which adds interest, allowing riders a downward view into the subway.  A boat-shaped gantry, made of stainless steel and mesh, is situated beneath the skylight; this is both aesthetically pleasing and a functional amenity (it allows workers to access the area for cleaning and changing light bulbs).  \n\nOne particularly clever element is a granite \u00d2wave\u00d3 sited at the point where the two stations, Atlantic and Pacific, cross \u00d0 and it succeeds in making these passageways flow.   Playing on the names Atlantic and Pacific, the overall idea is to suggest a place of landing and departure \u00d0 functions that both subway stations and seaports share.  To complete the metaphor, the central kiosk is constructed in the form of a lighthouse, which helps guide travelers through the maze-like complex.",

It's composed of over 5,000 pieces of glass in more than 70 different colors. The composition inverts the commuter\u00d5s visual experience of descending underground. The progression begins with an upper landing rendered in sparkling deep blues that reference the celestial ceiling of Grand Central Terminal\u00d5s Main Concourse and contrast the pale stone architecture of the terminal. It then bursts into a kaleidoscope of color on the lower mezzanine, dazzling against the backdrop of black granite in the renovated subway entrance.\n\nCamouflage serves as a representation of nature. The artwork's organic patterning contains a sense of life. Shapes appear fluid and imbue the surface with a swirling visual dynamism that mimics the pulsating energy of the station itself.",

        "art_description": "Sunset Park\u00d5s 36th Street subway station serves thousands of Brooklyn commuters daily. Owen Smith designed his brilliantly colored mosaic work An Underground Movement: Designers, Builders, Riders specifically for them, as \u00d2a celebration of the working people who have made the subway what it is today.\u00d3\n \nSmith\u00d5s vivid murals focus on the story of the subway\u00d5s creation and trumpet its importance. The artist describes the expansive works:  \u00d2The west wall depicts the designers and engineers who achieved this great engineering feat.  The panel on the north wall pays tribute to the workers who dug the tunnels and laid the 722 miles of track.  And the third panel represents the people who use the subway every day and whose lives are improved by it.\u00d3   In his stylized cityscapes, Smith highlights popular pastimes and haunts for New Yorkers and those who visit here.  On the Manhattan-bound side, for instance, the Rockettes are shown in all their high-kicking splendor.  And on the Brooklyn-bound side, Smith depicts a classic brownstone stoop with Coney Island in the background.  \n\nMuralists of Mexico\u00d5s Social Realist school \u00d0 particularly Diego Rivera, who produced important, large and often controversial works in the United States as well as Mexico \u00d0 influenced Smith in both his style and his choice of subject matter.  \u00d2Rivera taught many of the artists who produced public art under the WPA and the Federal Art Project of the 1930s and 1940s,\u00d3 he says.  \u00d2I was attracted to the strength and accessibility of their style and the educational as well as aesthetic quality of their art.  It told a story about the lives of the working people. These mosaic panels were designed in the same spirit.\u00d3",

Located near Frederick Douglass Circle, a gateway to Harlem, the artwork was originally installed in 1999 by Miotto Mosaic Art Studios, and it continues to evoke the spirit of migration, both of people who have found their home in Harlem, as well as the universal search for the feeling of home--in one\u00d5s heart and in the world. Imagery in the artwork includes houses atop stilts and wheels, ladders, the North Star, footprints, recurring circular patterns (both complete and incomplete), and African symbols of spiritual centering. These objects and a continuous pathway weave in and out of large simple shapes throughout the station, threading through the shifting dynamics of passage.",

The hand motions elicit an outpouring of sounds that evoke urban life and bring about duets between strangers waiting for their respective trains. Artist Christopher Janney creates sound sculptures and public art that use sound and motion.

Using \"Nature Rail\"'s characteristic visual elements \u00d1 specifically, plants and animals surviving on the urban stage \u00d1 Dezs\u0161 composed a cascading set of mosaic murals, re-contextualizing her unique visual iconography and infusing vibrant color onto the station\u00d5s platforms. The plant and animal motifs borrowed from \"Nature Rail\" link the two stations by offering visual continuity, while the different medium of mosaic creates a distinct visual identity for the New Utrecht Av station.  \n\nSpeaking about her inspiration for this artwork, Dezs\u0161 shared that her \"imagination was captured by how wild plants found ways to survive and thrive in this very urban area. From abandoned lots to areas between buildings, nature found ways to grow alongside construction sites, structures of steel and concrete, even in potholes. It made me smile every time I saw an uninvited, un-nurtured plant surviving entirely on its own on the urban stage.\" She envisions her artwork as a celebration of this \"urban thriving.\"",

The artist says, \"The identity of each face is specific, never to be repeated, even over thousands of generations, like the delicate changes of any flower's colors and shapes as it adapts to the Sun's motion...The face can be a portrait or a stylized fantasy - even when I'm making a portrait of an individual. There is so much in the face, which is comprised of only a few components that can form complex expressions with endless variations, speaking a language that is universally understood.\"",

        "art_description": "Nancy Spero\u00d5s Artemis, Acrobats, Divas, and Dancers at 66th Street at Lincoln Center, a series of twenty-two brilliantly colored glass mosaic panels, line the walls of the station.  Spero\u00d5s work evokes both the Lincoln Center\u00d5s performing arts institutions \u00d0 opera, ballet, classical music \u00d0 and the vibrant, artistic character of the Upper West Side neighborhood.  She conveys this through the use of iconic images of women both real and mythical, from such varied sources as archaeology, architecture, mythology and the contemporary world.\n\nIn her long career, Nancy Spero, in her website, says she has consistently focused her art on \u00d2challenging questions about women as artists and women as women.\u00d3  In the 1960s she began working as a figurative abstract painter with a political agenda.  Medium has always been important to her; she has generally avoided working on canvas, the usual way to success in the art world, preferring paper and collage.  To her, these symbolize  \u00d2women\u00d5s liberation from traditional language into communication that seemed more pertinent.\u00d3  Further, from the 1970s onward she rejected all but female images in her work and sometimes included text with depictions of partial female forms, addressing issues of women\u00d5s control over their own bodies.  Her present work often reveals an element of sadness, even despair: \u00d2In many of the works now I\u00d5m trying to depict a sense of the vitality of life, but also to pose the question: what does happen after the revolution?  There have to be solutions and there aren\u00d5t a lot of them\u00c9\u00d3 \n\nIn Artemis, Acrobats, Divas, and Dancers, the central icon of opera, the Diva, is repeated in various forms that lead and follow riders through the station, giving the illusion of movement and change.  In another area, Spero represents scenes from the subway and the city outside, the architectural backgrounds enlivened by musicians performing and athletes running.  Viewing the work, you intuit that you are in a sophisticated, theatrical place \u00d0 which is exactly, of course, what Lincoln Center, the area aboveground, is.",

The artwork depicts figural sculptures with seating elements and whimsical surface design on windscreen panels. Figures from local history as well as present-day residents were the inspiration for the stainless steel sculptures. The artist refers to the early days of the area such as the arrival of European settlers and the foundation of the Culver train line at the turn of the 20th century bringing an expansion of residents in South Brooklyn. This series of joyful sculptures also captures themes of family life and resourcefulness in the neighborhood. For the windscreen panels, the artist utilized a single design to create multiple unique compositions arranged in different configurations. The positive and negative shapes of the design mirror each other from across the platform at each station. Gardair created all of the artwork with a no-waste design framework which relates to the future of the neighborhood and the environmental impact of all of New York City. Passengers will travel through time and imagination on their commute when experiencing Julien Gardair\u00d5s We are each others artwork at these two Culver Line Stations.",

        "art_description": "In the mosaic artwork Gratitudes off Grand at the upgraded Grand Street (L) station in Brooklyn, Glendalys Medina reflects on their COVID-19 pandemic practice of taking 15-minute walks to get outside and cultivate gratitude. For the Grand Street station project, Medina would walk in each cardinal direction originating at station, return to their studio, and record the colors associated with memories cultivated during their strolls. Medina then used these colors to create abstract studies that build on their existing practice inspired by Ta\u2019no culture, Hip- hop and Latinx culture and music, and the way humans create sense out of the world, such as the way brains organize patterns.\n\nThe two mosaic panels at the Grand Street station appear on each platform mezzanine. On the Brooklyn-bound side, Medina reflects on the various communities who have comprised East Williamsburg and Bushwick over time. The large color fields represent the original Lenape inhabitants and Pan-African, Irish, Italian, Puerto Rican, and Dominican immigrants. On the Manhattan-bound side, more intimate color studies were derived from the artist\u00d5s experience of the neighborhood across seasons. A nearby church, birds in the springtime, the Moore Street Market, and the collar of a passing dog provided inspiration for these compositions of interlocking forms that call to mind schematic design drawings. Fabricated by Miotto Mosaic Art Studios, the two panels feature overlapping shapes that allow the eye to complete forms that are disrupted, inviting viewers to look a little longer and contemplate gratitude.",

        "art_description": "The hundreds of brilliant facets of Romare Bearden\u00d5s glass triptych throb with life, woven together by the heavy black thread of a subway train wending its way from tenements to skyscrapers.  The work began as a collage maquette; this was then faithfully and skillfully enlarged and transformed into a glowing artwork in jewel-like colored glass. \n\nBearden graduated from New York University with a degree in mathematics, and also studied art history and philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris, where he met Braque, Matisse, and Mir\u2014.  He also knew the American artist Stuart Davis, who had a marked effect on his work.  Interestingly, early in his career he was employed for a time as a songwriter and also worked as a social worker.  Both experiences would later be reflected in his art.  \n\nBearden consistently maintained that his concern was with universal human themes, not just those pertaining only to African Americans:  \u00d2I work out of a response and need to redefine the image of man in the terms of the Negro experience I know best.\u00d3  Or, as renowned writer Ralph Ellison said in a 1980 Mint Museum catalogue essay, \u00d2Bearden's art is not only an evaluation of his own freedom and responsibility as an individual and artist, it is an affirmation of the irrelevance of the notion of race as a limiting force in the arts.  These are works of a man possessing a rare lucidity of vision.\u00d3  \n\nCity of Light, is classic Bearden as it skillfully weaves together the spirit found in his beloved music, social concerns and his interest in trains.  Rendered in his characteristically bright colors, the work was the result of a long collaboration between Romare Bearden and the fabricators, Benoit Gilsoul and Helmut Schardt.   Following the artist\u00d5s death in 1988, they were able to complete the work from the preparatory studies and instructions he had left behind.",

The portraits feature renowned figures of history and culture, sourced from photographs and translated into glass mosaic. Beacons is a celebration of the energy and spirit of individuals who have been influential within the Bronx community and have received positive acclaim for their cultural, political and artistic contributions.\n\nThe eight figures highlighted in Gatson\u00d5s artwork include Gil Scott-Heron, Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, Audre Lorde, James Baldwin, Maya Angelou, Reggie Jackson and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Gatson juxtaposes the black and white portraits with hard-edge geometric lines using a palette of red, orange, yellow, black, grey, and green, which act as a metaphor for beaming light.\n\nThe portraits radiate with beauty and pride of these influential figures, and invite travelers to reflect on the past as well as find inspiration for the future. The station\u00d5s mosaic murals are an extension of Gatson\u00d5s earlier \u00d2Icons\u00d3 series, showing new ways to present biography and photography in a contemporary, bold and graphic way. Gatson\u00d5s artwork reveals a mix of influences -- performance, conceptualism, minimalism and constructivism, to name a few-- which are combined with an interest in history and representation.\n\nSouthbound platform artwork credits (L to R)\n\nGil Scott-Heron portrait derived from a photograph by Paul Natkin\n\nAudre Lorde portrait derived from a photograph by Jack Mitchell\n\nCelia Cruz portrait derived from a photograph owned by Celia Cruz Entertainment LLC\n\nJames Baldwin portrait derived from a photograph by Steve Schapiro\n\nNorthbound platform artwork credits (L to R)\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor portrait derived from a photograph by Timothy Greenfield-Sanders\n\nReggie Jackson portrait derived from a photograph by Doug McWilliams/ National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\n\nTito Puente portrait derived from a photograph by Martin Cohen\n\nMaya Angelou portrait derived from a photograph by Brian Lanker.",

With water as a central element, the artists depict a forest of native trees (oak, tulip tree, cottonwood, mountain ash, sweet maple, sassafras, and flowering dogwood) and birds (wild pheasant, osprey, great egret, cedar waxwing, cardinal, and grey catbird). Other panels farmland and the contemporary cityscape of homes, bridges, and distant skylines. Throughout, however, the artists compel us to view ourselves in an urban environment that is not separate from but is part of the natural landscape and its evolution.",

The artwork celebrates the station and the above-ground neighborhood that includes architectural gems such as the New York Life Building and Madison Square Park, which are just a few blocks away. The station artwork depicts seven flowering plants that are sourced from the Madison Square Park Conservancy\u00d5s Perennial Collection. The flowers include Red Buds, Magnolias, Hellebores, Witch Hazel, Daffodils, Hydrangea and Camellia. The blooming plants were chosen as representation of plant species that withstand changing climate conditions of the city.\n\nSimilar to an everchanging garden, ROAMING UNDERFOOT creates a delightful place to enjoy during every season. Blum\u00d5s intent was to capture some of the magic of the nearby park, regarded as an urban sanctuary, and to enhance the station environment for transit riders. Known for her beautiful floral studies that reveal astonishing detail, Nancy Blum transforms the study of botany into bold and expressive statements of art.",

        "art_description": "At the 7 Av station, artist David Rios Ferreira transforms twelve historic advertising niches and the North Mezzanine Passageway into portals connecting present-day concepts of home with a shared cultural connection to the planet across time. Inspired by the station\u00d5s proximity Prospect Park and the snapping turtles and read-eared sliders that reside there, Ferreira\u00d5s artwork \"Landscapes adrift\u00d1 cosmically woven and earthly bonded combines his graphic science-fiction drawing style with iconography drawn from ancient and Indigenous mythologies, local architecture, and the natural world. Miotto Mosaic Art Studios fabricated the artwork in glass mosaic and installed it in conjunction with ADA accessibility upgrades for the station.\n\nAlong the North Mezzanine Passageway, drawings of iridescent turtles populate the curved wall while recontextualized depictions of neighborhood maps, buildings, and plants emerge from their shells. These turtles hold significance in creation stories shared by Indigenous peoples such as the Lenape and those of the Northeastern Woodlands, as well as in Hindu and Chinese mythologies, where the earth is believed to be carried on the back of a giant turtle. Derived from interpretations found in scientific journals and Indigenous cultures, Ferreira\u00d5s turtles bridge the natural world with the mystical.\n\nFerreira continues the use of iridescent glass in the advertising niches as cropped views of the turtles and their shell architecture appear within the rectangular frames. Reminiscent of swirling algae in lakes, the iridescent glass background also evokes a sense of the otherworldly and cosmic as mosaic tesserae glisten as customers move through the station. Ferreira\u00d5s artwork encourages viewers to reflect on the changing histories and landscapes of the neighborhood while providing a fantastical narrative to show connections across cultural traditions.",

Miotto Mosaic Art Studios translated Fordjour\u00d5s layered surfaces into glass and ceramic mosaic, capturing the collage process inherent in his work. Based on his richly textured paintings created with humble materials such as newspaper, oil pastels, and charcoal, lines of drum majors, majorettes, dancers, and drummers joyfully parade along the platforms, and are accompanied by crowds of people and flags.\n\nFrom his historic research into the neighborhood, the artist touches on the legacy of parades through Harlem starting with the Harlem Hellfighters 369th Regiment in 1919 after WWI, through to the African American Day Parade founded during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s and continuing today. Fordjour\u00d5s artwork provides riders with a chance to encounter a celebration of community, history, and identity in the colorful art that complements the station\u00d5s improvements and reinforces the historic fabric of the station.\n\nDerek Fordjour is a Harlem-based artist of African-American heritage. In his richly textured paintings, the artist draws upon a variety of sources including sporting imagery, board games, and carnival motifs to explore ideas of vulnerability, aspiration, and structures of fairness. He has recently held residencies at the Sugar Hill Museum and the Sharpe-Walentas Studio Program, and was awarded the 2018 Deutsche Bank NYFA Fellowship Award. He is a graduate of Morehouse College, earned graduate degrees in Art Education from Harvard University, and painting from Hunter College.",

        "art_description": "Arts for Transit has strived to bring a successful collaboration between \u00d2architect/artist \u00d3 to fruition \u00d0 the artist and architect working within a shared vision.  The bewildering junction of subway lines of the Atlantic Avenue Terminal Complex presented a perfect opportunity to further explore this idea.  Trakas has created critically acclaimed public art works around the world, including a bridge at a knife factory in Thiers, France, called the Sword Bridge, which, although minimal, unmistakably evokes the idea of a blade; it is consummate Trakas: simple, thoughtful and even profound in attention to form and materials. \n\nAt Atlantic Avenue, the architects\u00d5 intent was to bring together a myriad of passages and stairways to create a functional space with a unified feeling. Trakas\u00d5s ideas are melded with the equally clear vision of architects di Domenico + Partners to  create forms and spaces that underscore both the efficiency and beauty of the cavernous space, once again evoking the philosophy under which the original subway was built.\n\nTrakas carefully selected the stone pavers and bollards incorporated into the plaza at the station.  The architects designed a skylight for the roof of the historic station kiosk to help illuminate the platform below.  The former entry building now includes a brick-sized opening equipped with a lens which adds interest, allowing riders a downward view into the subway.  A boat-shaped gantry, made of stainless steel and mesh, is situated beneath the skylight; this is both aesthetically pleasing and a functional amenity (it allows workers to access the area for cleaning and changing light bulbs).  \n\nOne particularly clever element is a granite \u00d2wave\u00d3 sited at the point where the two stations, Atlantic and Pacific, cross \u00d0 and it succeeds in making these passageways flow.   Playing on the names Atlantic and Pacific, the overall idea is to suggest a place of landing and departure \u00d0 functions that both subway stations and seaports share.  To complete the metaphor, the central kiosk is constructed in the form of a lighthouse, which helps guide travelers through the maze-like complex.",

        "art_description": "In For Want of a Nail, the artist team used a variety of materials to suggest the range and diversity of offerings of the Museum of Natural History, which one can enter directly from the subway station at 81st Street and Central Park West.  The work is a swirling assemblage of images, from outer space to the earth\u00d5s core, from the first organisms to emerge from the primeval ooze to mammals of today.  The artwork was a collaboration between MTA Arts for Transit and the American Museum of Natural History; the museum provided support and Arts for Transit\u00d5s interviews of their scientists, educators and docents inspired the design of the artwork.  \nGlass mosaic, glass tile, ceramic tile, granite, and bronze relief are combined in a variety of ways to highlight the ten key fields represented at the museum: anthropology, astronomy, earth and planetary sciences, entomology, herpetology, ichthyology, invertebrates, mamma logy, ornithology and vertebrate paleontology.  The result is a compelling visual treatise on the earth, its inhabitants \u00d0 both past and present \u00d0 and the heavens that surround it. \n\nThe mosaics depict animals both extant and extinct, the former in full color and the latter in gray tones.  They are arranged so that forebears are paired with those they preceded.  For instance, a dodo is shown with a crane and a mastodon with an elephant.  Why are dinosaurs pictured with the number 5 in red?  This is to symbolize the \u00d2fifth extinction,\u00d3 the planet-wide calamity that marked their demise.  But some of their descendants survived, as indicated by the crocodile skulking nearby.\n\nFor Want of a Nail, the title of which is taken from an old proverb, asks the viewer to ponder the way in which everything in the universe is connected and how it, the earth, and organisms have changed and continue to change over time.\n\nFor want of a nail,\nA shoe was lost;\nFor want of a shoe,\nA horse was lost;\nFor want of a horse,\nA rider was lost;\nFor want of a rider,\nA message was lost;\nFor want of a message,\nA battle was lost;\nFor want of a battle,\nA kingdom was lost:\nAll for the want of a nail.",

        "art_description": "Sculptor Deborah Masters created the \u00d2Coney Island Reliefs\u00d3 in cast concrete. The 1260 sq. ft. of relief panels fit within existing recesses in the viaduct. Tinted a terracotta color to harmonize with the sandstone color of the Ocean Parkway viaduct, a massive structure that carries the subway across six lanes of traffic and an Olmstead parkway, the reliefs portray scenes from the history and legends of Coney Island, including Neptune, a mermaid, beach, boardwalk, and amusement park scenes. The designs are based upon photographs, drawings, and interviews by the artist with local residents and visitors to the famed amusement park. On the north and south facing facades, there are six triangular shapes in which Neptune and the Mermaid repeat in paired groupings, as well as large rectangular panels at either end of the viaduct facade that feature scenes of Coney Island. \n\nThe work is a visual gateway into Coney Island, and a major accomplishment that met many technical challenges. The figures and images are modelled with expression, reflective of the large-scale sculpture for which the artist is known and has exhibited widely. The work seems an integral part of the historic structure and indeed, the recessed areas may have been intended for artwork that was never provided to the community, until now.",

The artwork, \"Made With Love,\" is a series of 28 triptych compositions that combine architectural and urban elements of the neighborhood with culinary dishes known and loved by the local community and visitors.  \n\nCombining hand drawing and digital illustration, Jeyifous captures iconic food practices that reflect the diverse cultural make-up of the neighborhood. Food items such as dumplings, egg tarts, kebabs, tacos, churros, borscht, and lasagna are morphed into building facades, store fronts, mailboxes, fruit stands, and subway cars. Imagery captured from the surrounding neighborhood is rendered into simplified, graphic shapes in vibrant hues.  \n\n\"Made With Love\" was translated into laminated glass panels by Glasmalerei Peters Studios and can be seen on both platforms of the station. The engaging and joyful work is meant to generate playful and whimsical responses from riders as they discover familiar elements from their cultures and communities.",

Ore-Giron visualizes the world as abstract forms and shapes, and envisions the interaction and interplay of these shapes as a reflection of societal dynamics. This exchange between forms and his use of geometries symbolizes the ways in which people of different communities \u00d1 such as those surrounding the Bay Pkwy station \u00d1 negotiate their relationships with each other and new places, a process of reinvention and creation.  \n\nThe 12 mosaic panels on each platform reference the corresponding journey. As commuters travel southbound towards Coney Island, Ore-Giron\u00d5s designs reference the natural world, with fluid arcs and warm colors evoking the feelings one might have when going to the beach. The northbound platform mosaics mimic the movement of gears and the mechanics of the human-made world, conjuring feelings of New York\u00d5s ecstatic urban environment.  \n\n\"People\u00d5s Instinctive Travels: Homage to the Tribe\" originates from Ore-Giron\u00d5s \"certain nostalgia for global modernism,\" wherein \"public works meant to create a kind of civic mindedness and unity.\" His dynamic visual language references this unity, combined with the timelessness of indigenous and craft traditions. It is Ore-Giron\u00d5s hope that these mosaics will offer subway riders a space to see the world anew through the shapes, forms, colors, and movements of these artworks.",

Inspired by Walt Whitman's \"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,\" the sun and moon rise and set on the city and its constant flow of people throughout time. Depicted in radiant gold and dazzling blue, 400 square feet of glass mosaic, fabricated by Mayer of Munich, appear in locations at the mezzanine and new stairways at the Driggs Avenue end of the station.  \n\nThe artwork draws upon the artist\u00d5s early experiences coming to New York and living in Williamsburg, with scenes of graceful dancers, whimsical characters, and a radiant sun and moon. Employing different illustration styles, the work presents a timeless tableau celebrating New York\u00d5s history and its people.\n\nIn each theatrical composition, an arabesque patterned curtain adorned with fairy tale figures provides an enchanting proscenium stage setting for these tableaux. The scenes are populated by elegant ballet performers that appear throughout Dzama\u00d5s oeuvre of drawings and paintings. Mischievous characters pop up throughout, and representing historical Brooklynites such as Bugsy Siegel and Captain Jonathan Williams, founder of Williamsburg.  \n\n\"In these works it is my intention to bring the sun, the sky, and the moon to the underground,\" Dzama said. \"What I love most about New York is its people, and for me it was important to represent them and all of their wonderful complexities and diverse beauty in the piece. People looking and quietly observing together. In the subway, it\u00d5s always a togetherness that bonds us uniquely like no other place in the world.\"",

        "art_description": "Christopher Russell\u00d5s artwork is centered on the image of the bee. The artist imagined the station as a kind of beehive, a center of activity, with many individuals converging, like bees, darting in and out, to and from their many pursuits. The historic building with its central entrance and peaked roof evokes the feeling of a beehive. The artist found the image of the bee as an appropriate motif since the station\u00d5s architecture is inspired by the Arts and Crafts style. During the Arts and Crafts period, artists and designers utilized the bee, the hive, and honeycomb extensively, in the decorative wall coverings, objects and furnishings.\n\nIncorporating this imagery, Russell designed 2 sets of gates and finials for the fences that surround the open spaces at each side of the station. The cast bronze gates are based on honeycombs, greatly magnified. These monumental honeycombs are populated by equally magnified bees depicted in their crowds, busily occupied. The cells of the honeycomb are open, allowing light to pass through, and bringing out the hexagonal pattern of the comb, which creates depth and visual interest, when viewed from a distance.\n\nThe finials, atop each the tallest posts along the fences, feature a single bee, larger than life, working on an equally exaggerated flower head. The bees are intended as an affirmation of nature in the city, reminding passers-by of their fertility, productivity, and community. The artwork was fabricated by Modern Art Foundry.",

While individuals are intrinsically unique, we all intersect and overlap through our shared experiences, at home and afar.  \n\nOlujimi references our universal connections and the infinite changing skies, whether it be in Johannesburg or Jerusalem, Beijing or Brooklyn, Rio or Rome. Amongst the shifting clouds, we all find a place to wander within the abstract spaces that hold infinite possibilities. The common place of human experience is where the sky begins.",

        "art_description": "A dominant theme in George Bates\u00d5 work is convergence and how nature, objects, and people meet and form a greater whole. If you view only the individual components of the whole you may fail to see the larger ideas and systems to which they are connected. At B.36th Street, he designed a lyrical composition with a bold, yet playful spirit, that expresses his feelings about the Rockaways. Created in glass block in the station stair landings, the glass brings in light and brightens the station. The design on the south bound side, which receives the strongest light, features a spiral formed of people\u00d5s heads, rendered in deep blue and heavy line. These are profiles that overlap one another, building up and snowballing into a large element, a community. This main section is accented by bursts and waves of color, pops of yellow among strikes of blue and occasional reds. Different elements were designed to reveal themselves at closer viewing. From afar the works reads as one unified design.\n\nThe northbound side of the station also has a large circular form; here it is bands of waving color set among abstracted and small scale geometric patterns. In the rhythm and flavor of the work, Bates shows his expertise as an artist who is best known for a vivid and animated style. Here he distills the essence of the beach side community that surrounds Beach 36 Street \u00d0 with a spirited joyous rendition that achieves its musical like title, with its waves and crescendos of color, pattern and form.\n\nThe art will resonate over time with riders making their daily commute to and from the station. In addition, the strong ocean light will project through the thick glass and the bands of color, creating colorful shadows that change as the sun passes overhead. At night the glass block artwork will appear to glow from within due to the station\u00d5s mezzanine interior light.\n\nBates is familiar with the neighborhood and the state of mind found in New York City\u00d5s beachfront string of neighborhoods. An avid surfer, he has been a regular visitor for over twenty years, forming bonds with locals and the landscape, in which he is pleased to have a hand, in his permanent artwork at the station.",

        "art_description": "Sunset Park\u00d5s 36th Street subway station serves thousands of Brooklyn commuters daily. Owen Smith designed his brilliantly colored mosaic work An Underground Movement: Designers, Builders, Riders specifically for them, as \u00d2a celebration of the working people who have made the subway what it is today.\u00d3\n \nSmith\u00d5s vivid murals focus on the story of the subway\u00d5s creation and trumpet its importance. The artist describes the expansive works:  \u00d2The west wall depicts the designers and engineers who achieved this great engineering feat.  The panel on the north wall pays tribute to the workers who dug the tunnels and laid the 722 miles of track.  And the third panel represents the people who use the subway every day and whose lives are improved by it.\u00d3   In his stylized cityscapes, Smith highlights popular pastimes and haunts for New Yorkers and those who visit here.  On the Manhattan-bound side, for instance, the Rockettes are shown in all their high-kicking splendor.  And on the Brooklyn-bound side, Smith depicts a classic brownstone stoop with Coney Island in the background.  \n\nMuralists of Mexico\u00d5s Social Realist school \u00d0 particularly Diego Rivera, who produced important, large and often controversial works in the United States as well as Mexico \u00d0 influenced Smith in both his style and his choice of subject matter.  \u00d2Rivera taught many of the artists who produced public art under the WPA and the Federal Art Project of the 1930s and 1940s,\u00d3 he says.  \u00d2I was attracted to the strength and accessibility of their style and the educational as well as aesthetic quality of their art.  It told a story about the lives of the working people. These mosaic panels were designed in the same spirit.\u00d3",

The Ailanthus tree is ubiquitous to Brooklyn and found in unlikely and inhospitable places. It\u00d5s beautiful lance shaped leaves pop up in cracks in the sidewalk and concrete walls and is a metaphor for the courage and determination of the people of Brooklyn. Chandelier references the idea of \u00d2lighting the way\u00d3 and is a reminder of the feeling when the lights of the train appear down the tracks, signaling the journey home. Hummingbirds are elegant and high energy and represent the vibe of Brooklyn. In creating the artwork, Baker recalled her childhood car journeys with her parents and the feeling of spotting an iconic colorful building. Baker seeks to capture the same elated, moment of wonder and believes public art can be transformative and speak to everyone.",

Trees are suggested by shaped iron and guns by manipulated pieces of steel.  Light is refracted by the glass elements to powerful effect.  Tauler says the bent metal forms remind him of his forays as a child into the marshlands near his home:  \u00d2I am profoundly aware of the importance of the environment to my art,\u00d3 he says.  \u00d2Especially interesting to me is the manipulation of light through the use of texture and reflective materials.\u00d3",

        "art_description": "Willie Birch\u00d5s Harlem Timeline, at the 135th Street subway station, continues the paean to Harlem luminaries.  But to put them into the proper context, the now-famous are shown among the ordinary people of Harlem going about their daily affairs \u00d0 at play, studying, going to church.  \u00d2It\u00d5s about being connected,\u00d3 Birch says.  \u00d2Harlem is a village built on global energy, infused with the histories of migrants from Africa, the American South, and the Caribbean.\u00d3\n\nBirch calls New Orleans his home, but he also maintains a studio in New York.  The theme of returning to roots often permeates his artwork.  As stated by fellow artist Robert Taplin writing in Art in America, among contemporary black artists \u00d2Birch is one of the most forthright in adopting an \u00d4Africanizing\u00d5 cultural model. \u00c9  In the end, it\u00d5s [his] clear sense of design that makes it all work.\u00d3\n\nIn Harlem Timeline, on the downtown platform, along with a depiction of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Birch shows Langston Hughes reading from his works and Reverend Adam Clayton Powell Jr. preaching to a rapt gathering.  Boxing champion Joe Louis is depicted triumphing over an opponent and Charlie Parker excels on the saxophone.  \n\nHeaded uptown, riders are treated to a moving rendition of the blues, with Billie Holiday singing her heart out.  Also shown are jazz greats Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane, playing away, and Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey in their search for justice and equality.  Community services are represented by Harlem Hospital and its predecessor. \n\nBirch received his Masters of Fine Art from the Maryland Institute College of Art. He is a recipient of fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts.  A recent exhibition in New York City featured mixed-media work that revealed neighbors and friends in New Orleans, a world now forever altered.",

Ik-Joong Kang\u00d5s Happy World colorfully expresses and celebrates its liveliness.  \u00d2Happy World  began when I was riding the subway every day.  I was fascinated by the different people and things I saw, so I took small canvases with me and began to create the images that became the work.  I hope these symbols of contemporary American life \u00d0 familiar, humorous, even strange or obscure \u00d0 will make the tens of thousands of people who ride the 7 train every day talk about what they see and share their impressions.\u00d3\n\nThe mural is composed of over two thousand ceramic tiles, and no two of them are alike.  They show community events and city views, familial gatherings, people at work and children at play \u00d0 everything from the humblest backyard to world-famous buildings such as the Guggenheim Museum.  \n\nFor his proposal, the artist carefully worked out the arrangement of the images in the context of the station:  \u00d2As subway passengers get on the escalator, they will get a glimpse of a world map on the wall facing them. As the escalator descends, they will get a closer look at the images on each tile. Each ceramic tile will function as part of a puzzle. \u00d3   The world\u00d5s continents are shown in shades of green, orange, and red.  \n\nAs the work\u00d5s title implies, Ik-Joong Kang\u00d5s New York is a thoroughly pleasant place to be.  And even if subway customers know that this is not always the case, it is still pleasant to contemplate, if only for a moment or two, how wonderful it would be if it were.",

The artist created the proposal in 2004 and, working with Dattner Architects, selected the site in an expansive wall facing a double-wide stairway and landing that leads from the mezzanine to the platforms of the A, C, B, D and 1 trains. Titled Whirls and twirls (MTA), the artwork is 53 feet wide and by 11 feet high and consists of 250 porcelain tiles in six colors, each cut to meet the artist's specifications. The artist created the drawing/maquette for the project, reviewed and selected materials, and approved color samples prior to his death in 2007.\n\nThe artist is known for his sculptures and his wall drawings, in which detailed directions are provided for the execution of the artwork in paint or pencil. The site-specific piece - unique because it is a permanent public installation of a wall drawing - is a bravura work of precision, with swooping curves and vertical and horizontal bars in vibrant color that completely fills the space. The tile was cut to the exact dimensions of the drawing to ensure that the scale of the work and the color sequences are as the artist intended.\n\nSol LeWitt (1928-2007) is a celebrated artist who has had hundreds of solo exhibitions in museums and galleries worldwide since 1965. His work includes more than 1,100 wall drawings, photographs, hundreds of works on paper, and geometry-based sculptures. An exhibition at Mass MOCA in North Adams, Massachusetts, features 105 wall drawings in a specially designed museum space and will be on view through 2033.",

        "art_description": "Walter Martin and Paloma Mu\u2013oz have turned the Canal Street Station into something at first glance reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock\u00d5s The Birds.  But the birds in The Gathering are not menacing but somehow comforting.  There are dozens of them in total \u00d0 174 grackles and blackbirds, in a number of different poses, and seven crows, all cast in bronze and given a glossy black patinated coating.  They stand in groups, like people waiting in the subway, thinking, conversing, or studiedly ignoring one another.  Most of them can be found roosting on railings, watching and serving as companions to the flocks of people using the transportation system.  Birds, the artists note, are very social creatures \u00d0 just like New Yorkers; riders may find echoes of themselves and other subway travelers in their lively, cocky, quizzical interactions.\n\nCanal Street has been a commercial area for many decades.  Once primarily a warehouse district, today it is a main artery of several busy neighborhoods, long-established Little Italy and Chinatown and the newer and more hip SoHo and TriBeCa.  The street\u00d5s offerings range from Chinese delicacies, produce and herbal medicines to electronics to restaurants serving every kind of dish in every price range.  \n\nBut one thing that Canal Street largely lacks is the leavening influence of nature.  The birds of A Gathering make up for this, enlivening the space and bringing relief from the sometimes oppressive commercialism of the area.  Walter Martin and Paloma Mu\u2013oz, whose studio is in Brooklyn, have collaborated on art for many years. As part of Arts for Transit\u00d5s Lightbox Project, they installed their series of \u00d2Travelers,\u00d3 in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.  They created of 20 sculptural vignettes and photographed them to appear to be snow globes, creating magical winter wonderlands.  Part of this series traveled to the Wilshire/Normandie Metro Rail station in Los Angeles as part of Metro Arts Lightbox Series.",

        "art_description": "At the 77th Street and Lexington Avenue subway station, Robert Kushner has created two large flower arrangements \u00d0 bouquets for any season and no season \u00d0 blending diverse artistic traditions such as Dutch flower paintings and Japanese screens.  While most neighborhoods are filled with flower shops, they are particularly spectacular on the Upper East Side, where they can command a pretty penny for their wares.  Kushner\u00d5s imagery captures the essence of a spring day.  Flowers are associated with many of the institutions in the neighborhood above \u00d0 hospitals, parks, and museums.  \n\nA painter, sculptor and printmaker, Kushner has always been fascinated by organic motifs.  He achieved fame in the 1970s for his forays into performance art, in which he often appeared in bizarre vegetable costumes, which many found the highlight of the performance.  A founder of the Pattern and Decoration Movement, he continues to feature vegetal motifs in his works, often along with geometric patterns and architectural shapes.  His work is clearly influenced by Chinese and Japanese art, in both subject matter and composition, and is also inspired by European and American artists such as Henri Matisse, Pierre Bonnard, Odilon Redon, and Georgia O\u00d5Keeffe.  \n\nThe artist has a special affinity for the Upper East Side neighborhood where his work appears: \u00d2This subway station is quite familiar to me \u00d0 serving the Whitney Museum, the Metropolitan Museum, and also Lenox Hill Hospital (where all three of my children were born).  I feel these cumulative experiences have directly influenced my thoughts about what I would like to look at when entering the station.  My intention is for people to enter the station, pass through the turnstile, look up and take note, and then go on with their day feeling a little lighter, having glimpsed something beautiful for a passing moment.\u00d3 \u00d2As people come and go from this stop, either to their job, home, Lenox Hill Hospital, Central Park, or the museums in the neighborhood, either recreation, culture, work or healing are often on people\u00d5s minds. Flowers can be associated with all of these activities and become particularly apt subject matter for this station. \u00d2",

        "art_description": "At the Avenue U station, on the Sea Beach line, Brooklyn-based artist Sally Gil created a series of fourteen mosaics entitled Edges of a South Brooklyn Sky. Reflecting on the Gravesend neighborhood where the Avenue U station is located, Gil used her poetic style to re-interpret and re-situate recognizable places and objects found throughout the area. Each of the fourteen mosaic panels whimsically represents Gravesend, and the diverse communities living there past and present. \n\nThere are seven mosaics on each of the station\u00d5s platforms, each containing a roving skyline and depicting familiar structures and things, such as Italian rainbow cookies, a quail egg, a Mexican Concha cookie, railroad tracks, and even the station house at the Avenue U subway entrance. Local architectural structures are placed close to the center line of all fourteen mosaics, because, as Gil says, \u00d2the horizon line is where the business of living happens.\u00d3 Concurrently the myriad objects, representing the rich social texture of the multiethnic Gravesend community, float amidst the day and night skies. This is where, as Gil says, \u00d2the internal life lives, all the complex and mystifying contemplations that move us.\u00d3 The day and night skies are reversed in form and concept across the platforms, helping to situate daily commuters in time and space, as they leave from and arrive back to the Avenue U station. \n\nSally Gil uses painting and mixed media collage to make her artworks. For the Avenue U station, her fourteen, original mixed media pieces were fabricated in glass mosaic by Mosaicos Venezianos de M\u017dxico. Gil worked closely the mosaicists to replicate her small scale works into the fourteen large scale mosaic murals now permanently located along the platforms. As riders move through the Edges of a South Brooklyn Sky, artist Sally Gil reminds us that, \u00d2every day we are making our place in the world, and the subway is the conduit that transports us. We live on a physical plane, while dwelling in our thoughts and imaginations -- the world of our own stories. Ultimately I believe, although from differing places, we all want the same things: To live peacefully, with what we need and want\".",

Photographed with the artist\u00d5s deadpan sense of humor, the dogs take on human attributes, from wearing street clothes like a shiny raincoat or flannel shirt, to being grouped like passengers as they gaze into space or peer down the platform as if waiting for the train. Situated in bold blocks of color, the larger-than-life mosaic dogs are bursting into space and interacting with commuters. The mosaic fabricator, Mayer of Munich, interpreted the photographs taken for this project by meticulously transforming the facial expressions, skin textures and patterns of the dogs\u00d5 vibrant attire into glass mosaic. Wegman has lived and worked in the neighborhood for decades, and together with his dogs Flo and her brother Topper they have created images that enliven this busy station.\n\nSpeaking about the project, Wegman said, \u00d2I wanted to create portraits of individual characters, people who you might see next to you on the platform. For these I dressed the dogs in more or less ordinary clothes, nothing too fashionable. I was very interested in the way in which photographs, even the out of focus dogs in the background of some images, could be translated into mosaic by Mayer of Munich, who skillfully turned grey stones into grey dogs.\u00d3",

Six panels are double framed with double layers of unique, swirling waves. In the sunlight, they reflect and project patterns of spinning motion onto the pathway of commuters which invites interaction and adds a playful spirit to the commute. The panels are functional as well, protecting the passengers from wind and weather. For her artwork Soar, Mia Pearlman created delicate, miniature papercut sculptures that were transformed through fabrication of hefty plates of steel into the final magical art forms. In creating her design, Pearlman was inspired by standing on the elevated platform and the feeling of closeness to the sky. While waiting for the train, she felt that one is encouraged to contemplate the weather, clouds and colors, all constantly shifting by the moment. The curving, perforated metal panels echo the air currents and the sky above, connecting us to place and reminding us of the beauty inherent in these natural phenomena.",

In a way, Harvey's artwork can be seen as a counterpart of the terminal's famous ceiling.  And it is more practical since the landmarks  in the mosaics help subway riders to orient themselves in the station and in the city.\u000bQueens is portrayed as an important focal point from which the city's looming silhouette can be viewed.  At a time when images of the skyline can be associated with tragedy, Look Up, Not Down tries to reclaim the skyline as an image of hope and beauty.  The sun marks the former Wold Trade Center, reminding us that nothing is absolute,  In years to come, the city continues to reinvent itself, the mosaics will serve as a view of a vanished moment in time.\u000bHarvey's work includes video, installation art, and painting.  It is, she says, \"generally concerned with the theoretical and social implications\" of art.  In her 2001 New York Beautification Project she explored these concerns  in the streets, in a transgressive way but with redeeming social virtue; at forty sites throughout the city, she painted oval-shaped traditional landscape paintings-but all on top of defaced surfaces.",

        "art_description": "At the E 149 St station, the mosaic artwork \"Bronx River\" by Glenn Goldberg unfolds across two sections located on the mezzanine level. Goldberg was inspired by the recent efforts made by environmental groups to clean and restore the Bronx River and sought to create a lush landscape featuring the river\u00d5s natural inhabitants. Patterned representations of egrets, wood ducks, and other birds populate Goldberg\u00d5s scenes as trees and flowers emerge near the flowing river. Improvisational, repetitive dots, a hallmark of Goldberg\u00d5s art practice, appear throughout the composition, which was fabricated into mosaic and installed by Miotto Mosaic Art Studios.\n\nWith his artwork, Goldberg aims to remind urban subway riders about their connection to the local landscape and encourage their participation in its appreciation and upkeep. Goldberg cited the many natural attractions in the Bronx, such as the New York Botanical Garden, Bronx Zoo, Pelham Bay Park, Orchard Beach, and Bronx River, as rich sites of exploration for city dwellers. Goldberg hopes his colorful, patterned river scenes and its various creatures enliven commuters\u00d5 days and encourage mindfulness related to the important, nearby water source.",

As passengers embark on their subway commute, they are greeted by 14 glass and ceramic mosaic panels, viewed from both sides of the platform. Mosaika Art & Design translated Berr\u2019o\u00d5s series of collaged paintings, built from patterned papers, into richly textured and colorful mosaics. The surreal and fantastical compositions are layered with vibrant patterns, figures playing instruments and folkloric animals including cheetahs, swans, parrots, and butterflies.\n\nThe artwork panels are evocative of the drama and majesty of journeys taken by individual travelers who may have immigrated from another country, state, or borough. The artist strives to inspire and remind passengers that they are in the realm of possibility, beauty, and magic. Berr\u2019o encourages viewers to explore their exterior and inner worlds of creativity, mystery, and joy.",

The simple forms, such as stripes and diamonds, become dynamic patterns when repeated, suggesting everything from ancient textiles, tapestry to fractals and microscope photography.\n\nMaureen McQuillan makes abstract, geometric forms and patterns in her paintings and drawings. She applies ink lines in layers of acrylic polymer with museum board which are subsequently manipulated to fold and bend in undulating ripples. The geometric patterns in Crystal Blue Persuasion reflect the repetitive nature of commuting, that is at once familiar and yet, each day, always different.",

Masstransiscope turns the subway into a movie machine, presenting a colorful, animated \"moving picture\" to commuters as the train moves through the tunnel. With heavy cleaning by volunteers, the artwork became visible again in 2008. \n\nThe artwork has been viewed by millions of commuters from subway cars leaving the northbound platform of the DeKalb Avenue station on the express track. The 228 hand-painted panels are viewed through a series of vertical slits set into a specially constructed housing that runs the full 300' length of the old station. The piece works on the principle of the Zoetrope, a 19th century optical toy. \n\nThe movement of the train passing in front of the exhibition creates the illusion of a 20-second animated movie. In a regular movie the film passes through a projector to create an illusion of motion and the audience sits still. With Masstransiscope it is the audience that moves while the film stays in place.",

        "art_description": "For many years, the Brooklyn Museum has been the repository for numerous ornamental architectural forms salvaged from significant New York City buildings that were nonetheless demolished.  Seventy-eight of these artifacts are installed in the Eastern Parkway/Brooklyn Museum subway station to enrich the environment and to create an introduction to the museum above.  Among these are plaques, lunettes, keystones and other decorative elements that have long served, and continue to serve, to raise viewers\u00d5 appreciation of the city\u00d5s architectural heritage.  As reinstalled here, they give visitors a foretaste of the riches of the museum\u00d5s collections.\n\nThe entrance to the subway station was redesigned as a part of an enormous and ambitious project to improve the appearance and public access to the Eastern Parkway side of the museum.  As reoriented, it provides emerging passengers \u00d0 many are visiting school children \u00d0 a welcoming view of the new museum entry structure and public plaza in front of the building designed by Polshek Partnership Architects and completed in 2004.  The salvaged and repositioned architectural elements add to the transitional experience, drawing attention to the classical fa\ufffdade of McKim, Mead and White\u00d5s original structure where similar elements appear.  \n\nThe project is an outstanding example of institutional collaboration.  The Brooklyn Museum, working with MTA Arts for Transit and Vel Riberto Consulting, selected the artifacts and donated them to the project.  New mosaic designs were added as well, to set off the objects and to make connections with the architecture of the station.",

        "art_description": "145th Street\nDEREK FORDJOUR\nPARADE, 2018\nGlass and ceramic mosaic\n\nGlass and ceramic mosaic artwork by Derek Fordjour appears throughout the historic 145th St-Lenox Av station, and celebrates the African-American parade tradition in Harlem and its pageantry. Miotto Mosaic Art Studios translated Fordjour\u00d5s layered surfaces into glass and ceramic mosaic, capturing the collage process inherent in his work. Based on his richly textured paintings created with humble materials such as newspaper, oil pastels, and charcoal, lines of drum majors, majorettes, dancers, and drummers joyfully parade along the platforms, and are accompanied by crowds of people and flags.\n\nFrom his historic research into the neighborhood, the artist touches on the legacy of parades through Harlem starting with the Harlem Hellfighters 369th Regiment in 1919 after WWI, through to the African American Day Parade founded during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s and continuing today. Fordjour\u00d5s artwork provides riders with a chance to encounter a celebration of community, history, and identity in the colorful art that complements the station\u00d5s improvements and reinforces the historic fabric of the station.\n\nDerek Fordjour is a Harlem-based artist of African-American heritage. In his richly textured paintings, the artist draws upon a variety of sources including sporting imagery, board games, and carnival motifs to explore ideas of vulnerability, aspiration, and structures of fairness. He has recently held residencies at the Sugar Hill Museum and the Sharpe-Walentas Studio Program, and was awarded the 2018 Deutsche Bank NYFA Fellowship Award. He is a graduate of Morehouse College, earned graduate degrees in Art Education from Harvard University, and painting from Hunter College.",

As passengers move through the 72 St station, messages of hope that appear to be handwritten, float in the clouds, as the perspective shifts in each artwork. The words, Remember, Dream, or Imagine Peace, punctuate the daily commute with a hopeful, reflective spirit. The transformation of photographs into mosaic sky paintings with subtle gradations in color and tone, creates a visually striking station environment.\n\n\u00d2I\u00d5m thrilled that my new work, SKY, will be opening at the 72 St subway station just steps from my home and Strawberry Fields, which I created in memory of my late husband. It will bring the sky underground, so it\u00d5s always with us. I hope this will bring peace and joy to my fellow New Yorkers for many years to come.\u00d3 - Yoko Ono\n\nYoko Ono is a multimedia artist whose work in performance, sculpture, film, music, and writing, first began in New York in the early 1960s.

Sixteen panels of faceted glass murals narrate the daily moments of citizens interacting with the motions of trains in the urban setting.  As Robinson observes, \u00d2A simple subway ride is a cultural exploration, a cross-section of a city as it moves from past to present and onto tomorrow.  All races, creeds, and colors interconnect on a common path to an endless variety of destinations. Each rider enriches by daily discoveries of new faces, places, and things,  Each individual work presented in this series is part of a larger whole, strung together, as it were, like the links in a chain or, more appropriately, the cars of a train. They are vignettes made of memory and experience, an ode to a lifetime spent riding in and dreaming on the train, as it speeds through the darkness and into the light.\u00d3",

Together, they reflect almost a century of service the station has provided.\n\nAdditionally, the industrial elements, attaching to the two \u00d2spinning\u00d3 forms, represent the whirring machines that gave this former manufacturing district its character. The form at right is bursting through the frame, symbolizing the future of the neighborhood which is evolving rapidly into a sophisticated urban community. To the artist, the lines escaping the frame are \u00d2offshoots\u00d3 representing the future of the subway. This future will include Wifi as well as new stations that will literally take us in new directions.\n\nAlthough the background may seem abstract, historical references were included that riders may decipher as they pass by. Handholds, rivets, ironwork, and the No. 7 lines extracted from the subway map have all become the visual elements in the work. Although the actual references to these forms may be concealed, a frequent rider will unravel these visual puzzles. Hunters Point Avenue Project is an imaginary machine honoring an industrial past and fueled by Hunters Point\u00d5s promising future.",

        "art_description": "Nancy Holt's steel ceiling sculpture incorporating lighting at the Fulton Street and Broadway/Nassau subway station, is an example of Arts for Transit's early efforts to have the artist work closely with the architect of the station, Lee Harris Pomeroy, to integrate the artwork with the architecture.    \n\nAn environmental artist, Holt creates art by giving physical form to universal cycles of the sun, moon, and stars.  Previous work concentrating on the heavens has included her Sun Tunnels (Great Basin Desert, Utah, 1973-76), a site-specific work with four tunnels aligned to the rising and setting of the sun on the summer and winter solstices.  In the upper half of each tunnel are holes in the configuration of a constellation, the holes differing in diameter according to the magnitude of the stars they represent.  The sun, also a star, shines through the holes casting ellipses and circles of light on the bottom of the tunnels during the day.  Holt\u00d5s Dark Star Park (Rosslyn,  Arlington, Virginia, 1979-1984) is an urban renewal project consisting of pipes, tunnels, circular pools and spheres that the artist thinks of as fallen stars.\n\nIn Astral Grating, Holt has surrounded lights with graduated circular rings making domed openings in a dropped steel grate ceiling.  \"The rings and light fixtures in this ceiling light sculpture are in the configuration of the stars in five constellations: Aries, Auriga, Canis Major, Cygnus and Piscus Austrinus,\" says Holt.  The number of lights in a cluster and the diameter of the domed openings vary in size according to the brightness of the stars represented.   The heavens have thus been brought underground.\n\nAs part of the new Fulton Street Transit Center, plans are for Astral Grating to be reinstalled into the reconfigured passageways.",

The viewer grapples with the aspects of layers of space and the kinetics of movement and stillness, to evoke a mood that is often uplifting and suggestive of powerful, poetic imagery.\u00d3   The location of the work at the West Farms Square \u00d0 East Tremont Avenue station is not coincidental, for nearby is the Bronx Zoo.

        "art_description": "Brooklyn, New Morning at the Broadway Junction subway station in Brooklyn consists of 75 faceted glass panels, no two alike, which are arranged into a series of murals throughout the complex as well as a seven-by-ten-foot glass mosaic mural wall.   Al Loving, who created the work, talks about the medium: \n\nFaceted glass is an opportunity to work with real light \u00c9 In ancient Chinese culture the spiral was the tip of the flame.  In contemporary time it is a symbol of continuity.  I have tried to bring a spirit of inclusiveness to this project. \n\nLoving has said of the work that it expresses a \u00d2spirit of interdependence and interconnection as an important aspect of the American experience,\u00d3 reflecting the fact that this large station is literally a cultural crossroad.  Working with natural light, the artist aims to \u00d2fuse human animism with intellectual visual consciousness.\u00d3  The overall effect of the work is to bring a new liveliness into the station; its vividly colorful and energetic forms introduce a sense of optimism and well-being.  \n\nAl Loving, a well-known African American collage artist, painter, and educator, enjoyed a long and productive career.  In 1969, his hard-edged geometric paintings in a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of Art brought him to the attention of the museum-going public.  He was fascinated with the shape of a spiral and spent much of his life exploring this form as well as inquisitively studying the properties of bright and bold colors.  Loving\u00d5s work has been described as fluid.  In 1974, in a New York Times review, he described his multi-layered, acrylic painted constructions as \u00d2dynamically composed reliefs, wall pieces that energize the space around them, seemingly almost to be caught in the act of moving across the wall.\u00d3  This dynamic quality infuses Brooklyn, New Morning as well, but this time in glass and glass mosaic.",

        "art_description": "The landmarked Station House at Avenue H in Midwood, Brookyln was originally built at the turn of the century as a real estate office for the surrounding community of Fiske Terrace, an early example of planned suburban development and a neighborhood which is graced by well-kept homes and landscaped streets. When the station was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2004, the Commission wrote that Avenue H is \u00d2the city\u00d5s only shingled wooden cottage turned transit station house\". To celebrate this uniquely charming site, artist Ed Kopel animates the exterior of the building with his new piece, Brooklyn Bucolic, transforming an unused colonnade into an active community porch.\n\nThe artwork, along the north and east fa\ufffdades of the Station House, consists of casual groupings of cast bronze rocking chairs, anchored in place. The chairs are modeled upon rockers produced by the Shaker Community in Mount Lebanon, New York during last quarter of the 19th Century and the first quarter of the 20th \u00d0 a timeframe contemporaneous with the development of Fiske Terrace from the establishment of the Brighton Line in 1878 to the completion of home construction in the 1920\u00d5s. Each has a unique patina treatment to make them more inviting and appropriate to a cozy porch setting.\n\nThe chairs vary in size accommodating a variety of users and suggesting a dialogue among them. Each chair, though similar in style to one another, is subtly different with a variety of weaves, colors and patterns. The colors of the rocking chairs recall and harmonize with the decorative hues of the surrounding Queen Anne and Colonial houses. Brooklyn Bucolic is, in part, an effort to recall the graciousness of front-porch society from days gone by. The chairs were fabricated by JP Parnas Woodworking and Polich Tallix.",

His work is expressive and energetic in its line and movement, the perfect start or finish to a day at the beach, and a welcome burst of color to commuters in this Rockaway neighborhood.\n\nThe expressive nature of faceted glass has been maximized to use optical effects and hand painting to bring Miller's artwork to life.

        "art_description": "Nature Rail, created by Andrea Dezs\u0161, is a stainless steel sculptural work installed in the railings of the station\u00d5s transfer areas connecting the D with the N line. Nature Rail is composed of five modular compositions by Dezs\u0161\u00d5s which can be combined depending on the location and configuration of the station railings.\n\nThe plant and animal life that survives on its own, in the urban environment surrounding the elevated train captured Dezs\u0161\u00d5s imagination and served as the central theme of Nature Rail. Plants\u00d1trees, vines, flowers, and small, wild animals\u00d1grasshoppers, bees, birds and rabbits, are depicted in silhouetted details using laser cut-out with sandblasted finishes. The resulting work resembles the traditional paper cut, a popular folk art medium familiar to many of the ethnic groups who make Bensonhurst their home. For Dezs\u0161, Chinese cut paper art may differ from Italian, Jewish or Mexican decorative and folk cut paper art, yet there are common elements among each, including natural subjects and varying degrees of symmetry. With her work, she creates a delightful visual focal point, which can be seen by all who enter the station as well as those on the street below.",

Butterflies similarly are used to signify the life cycle, from gestation to birth to the change into adulthood.

        "art_description": "At the 7 Av station, artist David Rios Ferreira transforms twelve historic advertising niches and the North Mezzanine Passageway into portals connecting present-day concepts of home with a shared cultural connection to the planet across time. Inspired by the station\u00d5s proximity Prospect Park and the snapping turtles and read-eared sliders that reside there, Ferreira\u00d5s artwork \"Landscapes adrift\u00d1 cosmically woven and earthly bonded combines his graphic science-fiction drawing style with iconography drawn from ancient and Indigenous mythologies, local architecture, and the natural world. Miotto Mosaic Art Studios fabricated the artwork in glass mosaic and installed it in conjunction with ADA accessibility upgrades for the station.\n\nAlong the North Mezzanine Passageway, drawings of iridescent turtles populate the curved wall while recontextualized depictions of neighborhood maps, buildings, and plants emerge from their shells. These turtles hold significance in creation stories shared by Indigenous peoples such as the Lenape and those of the Northeastern Woodlands, as well as in Hindu and Chinese mythologies, where the earth is believed to be carried on the back of a giant turtle. Derived from interpretations found in scientific journals and Indigenous cultures, Ferreira\u00d5s turtles bridge the natural world with the mystical.\n\nFerreira continues the use of iridescent glass in the advertising niches as cropped views of the turtles and their shell architecture appear within the rectangular frames. Reminiscent of swirling algae in lakes, the iridescent glass background also evokes a sense of the otherworldly and cosmic as mosaic tesserae glisten as customers move through the station. Ferreira\u00d5s artwork encourages viewers to reflect on the changing histories and landscapes of the neighborhood while providing a fantastical narrative to show connections across cultural traditions.",

The Northbound platform includes grilles based on leaves and branches of Sumac (Rhus typhina), Swamp White Oak (Quercus bicolor), Tulip (Liriodendron tulipifera) and Tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica) trees. These trees were common in the forest that covered the Bronx until the mid -19th century when land development began for the creation of farms, highways, and industry.

        "art_description": "In the mosaic artwork Gratitudes off Grand at the upgraded Grand Street (L) station in Brooklyn, Glendalys Medina reflects on their COVID-19 pandemic practice of taking 15-minute walks to get outside and cultivate gratitude. For the Grand Street station project, Medina would walk in each cardinal direction originating at station, return to their studio, and record the colors associated with memories cultivated during their strolls. Medina then used these colors to create abstract studies that build on their existing practice inspired by Ta\u2019no culture, Hip- hop and Latinx culture and music, and the way humans create sense out of the world, such as the way brains organize patterns.\n\nThe two mosaic panels at the Grand Street station appear on each platform mezzanine. On the Brooklyn-bound side, Medina reflects on the various communities who have comprised East Williamsburg and Bushwick over time. The large color fields represent the original Lenape inhabitants and Pan-African, Irish, Italian, Puerto Rican, and Dominican immigrants. On the Manhattan-bound side, more intimate color studies were derived from the artist\u00d5s experience of the neighborhood across seasons. A nearby church, birds in the springtime, the Moore Street Market, and the collar of a passing dog provided inspiration for these compositions of interlocking forms that call to mind schematic design drawings. Fabricated by Miotto Mosaic Art Studios, the two panels feature overlapping shapes that allow the eye to complete forms that are disrupted, inviting viewers to look a little longer and contemplate gratitude.",

        "art_material": "Glass Mosaic",
        "art_description": "In these dramatic murals the artist, Jack Beal, cleverly likens the subway to classical myths that deal with the relationship between goings-on on aboveground and below ground. \n\nTrained in art school as an abstract expressionist, Jack Beal soon turned toward figuration in his works, eventually achieving great success and becoming a leading realist.  He often stated, \u00d2I will never be satisfied until I obtain the believability of the seventeenth century Dutch painters.\u00d3    Ironically, now his interest has turned back to abstraction, he says.\n\nThe artist explains that he based this work on the Greek myth of Persephone.  In The Return of Spring mythological figure Persephone is shown running to her mother, Demeter, according to the terms of a pact Demeter had made with Hades, Persephone\u00d5s husband: Persephone would be allowed to return to earth and her mother for the rest of eternity \u00d0 provided that she ate nothing before leaving the Underworld.  But \u00d0 shades of Eve in Eden \u00d0 Persephone spied a pomegranate on the way out and could not resist taking a bite . . . \n\nThe Onset of Winter completes Beal\u00d5s story.  Persephone, having eaten the pomegranate, now is forced to renegotiate the contract.  From now on, she is allowed to spend six months on earth, but must spend the other six down below, autumn and winter in the Underworld with her husband and spring and summer aboveground with her mother \u00d0 thus the origin of the seasons.  A rueful Persephone is shown at the top of the stairs, knowing she must descend but not wanting to go. \n\nAs with Lichtenstein and Lawrence, place and time \u00d0 a particular place and a particular time, but with an implied universality \u00d0 are the theme.  Time passes, people and things come and go, but there is always a d\u017dj\u02c6 vu quality lurking just beneath the surface.",

Bringing comfort and various association to people, flowers have many meanings and uses. Arredondo uses lilies and crocuses to reflect renewal, hope and awaking, while marigolds, morning glories and daisies are associated with remembrances, commemorations and fiestas. Pansies and morning glories suggest warm weather. Blue, purple and pink roses are full of magic and celebration.

In a subtle way, the brilliantly colored forms evoke the feeling of the swirling cosmos.  For this commission, the artist produced a series of drawings in the exact size of the window openings, carefully considering the component shapes and colors and the fact that the drawings would later be translated into a new and different medium, faceted glass.\n\nAccording to the artist, he is particularly attracted by \u00d2the idea of traveling in infinite space, which is as a passenger on the Earth Express line, experienced through the cycle of the seasons.\u00d3  In his proposal to Arts for Transit, he brought this fascination with him.  He was particularly happy that the project involved windows, he says \u00d0 \u00d2a new and exciting medium for me to work with, faceted glass. \u00c9  These windows have allowed me to expand my understanding of the possibilities that this concept has as public art, also what and how different mediums expand the impact that a work of art has on the public.\u00d3\n\n\u00d2My art has always been informed by my interest in African art and music, the African American experience, the Cubist school, and contemporary American painters,\u00d3 Ausby says. \u00d2The connection between art and spirit, or rather how visual art becomes a voice for religious or spiritual belief, intrigues me.  It is my hope that these windows express what I feel is the spirit of New York, the hustle and bustle, the fast pace of the city.\u00d3",
